            "AI has taken over the world in recent years and will still be in the next decade. Can’t we imagine coming back to life before AI? I hardly think so, as AI has started complementing how we live. The breakthrough of AI into everyday life did not happen suddenly; instead, it was intentional by some individuals. Many of these individuals are what we refer to as the leaders in AI.\n",
            "Leaders in AI don’t necessarily need to be big CEOs of companies or wealthy investors. They could come from any walk of life but still contribute something significant to the AI development we still discuss today. These individuals and their inspiring stories are what we are going to discuss in this article.\n",
            "Who are these individuals? Let’s get into it.\n",
            "1. Andrew Yan-Tak Ng\n",
            "Thanks to his contribution to the field, Andrew Ng's name often comes up when discussing machine learning or deep learning. As the founder of Coursera, which taught millions of individuals, he could be considered an inspirational leader in AI and a legend. But, many behind-the-scenes moments make him so revered.\n",
            "Andrew graduated at the top of his undergraduate class in 1997, majoring in three degrees: Statistics, economics, and computer science. From 1996 to 1998, he focuses his research at AT&T Bell Labs on reinforcement learning, feature selection, and model selection. His research started to become renowned in 1998 when he built an automatically indexed web search engine for machine learning research papers on the web.\n",
            "After finishing his Ph.D., he went through an academic teaching career at Stanford University, where he taught his students data mining, big data, and machine learning. At this university, he began advocating for using GPUs in deep learning. This approach, though controversial at the time, has since become the standard.\n",
            "Starting in 2012, he co-founded Coursera with Daphne Coller with his spirit to provide free learning for everyone. In a similar timeline, he also worked at Google, where he founded the Google Brain Deep Learning Project, and worked at Baidu until 2017. After that, he founded Deeplearning.ai as a platform to learn deep learning online and a Landing AI startup focusing on providing AI-powered SaaS products. Since then, Andrew has focused more on democratizing AI for the public.\n",
            "With all the works that Andrew Ng has produced, he has opened pathways for many people into machine learning and deep learning. He has been awarded this achievement by many recognitions, including in 2013 as Time's 100 Most Influential People, in 2014 Fortune's 40 Under 40, and in 2023 as Time AI 100 Most Influential People.\n",
            "By keeping his focus and his willingness to provide a learning pathway for many people, Andrew Ng's story undoubtedly inspires anyone to follow.\n",
            "2. Fei-Fei Li\n",
            "If you ever heard of ImageNet, you should know its founder is Fei-Fei Li. As we know, ImageNet is an extensive visual database used for rapidly advancing computer vision development, where more than 14 million images have been hand-annotated and used widely. From one dataset, it’s developed into an essential part of deep learning research.\n",
            "Fei-Fei Li has an impressive educational background; she graduated with high honors as an undergraduate with a physics major and studied computer science and engineering. Even with high honors, she could still balance her work with her work at that time when she came back home every weekend to work at her parent's shop.\n",
            "She received her Ph.D. in 2005 and has served an academic career from assistant professor to full professor at Stanford University. During that time, she also worked at Google from 2017 to 2018, where she expressed her opinion about Project Maven (Military initiative). She said her principle is about human-centered AI to benefit people positively and benevolently.\n",
            "At Stanford, she established an initiative called SAILORS (Stanford AI Lab OutReach Summers), which aims to educate 9th-grade high school girls in AI education and research. Since then, it’s evolved to AI4ALL, which aims to increase diversity and inclusion in artificial intelligence. \n",
            "Her motivation is always about democratizing AI for humans, where some refer to her as a \"researcher bringing humanity to AI.\" With all her work, she has gained many achievements, notably in 2018 as America's Top 50 Women In Tech by Forbes and in 2023 as Time AI100.\n",
            "From a humble beginning, her persistence and principle made her one of the AI leaders we can always look upon.\n",
            "3. Demis Hassabis\n",
            "You might have heard about DeepMind, a Google Subsidiary that aims to bring artificial intelligence into AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). But did you know the founder? It’s none other than Demis Hassabis, the CEO and the co-founder.\n",
            "Demis Hassabis has been a child prodigy in chess since 4 years old and became the master at 13. He also completed his A-and scholarship-level exams at ages 15 and 16. With the chess-winning money, he bought himself his first computer and self-taught programming.\n",
            "In his gap year at university, he started to work as a game computer developer. His notable achievement is his work as the lead programmer for the game Theme Park. In his gaming development career, he established his Elixir Studio studio, where he tried to develop a highly ambitious game called Republic: The Revolution but has since scope down as the development takes too long. The studio closed down in 2005, but many of his experiments for AI simulation in the game inspired his works in the future.\n",
            "In 2009, he received a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience, which he then focused many of his works on the field of imagination, memory, and amnesia. During this time, he also gained a breakthrough in his research that linked the process of imagination and episodic memory. These ideas are what he called the simulation engine of the mind. \n",
            "In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind, which aims to combine neuroscience and machine learning to achieve AGI. In 2013, the company launched a training algorithm called Deep Q-Network that could play ATARI games at a superhuman level using only the raw pixels input. In 2014, Google bought DeepMind at £400 million and has since launched many breakthrough developments. DeepMind, in the current time, has advanced much research in deep learning and reinforcement learning, pioneering deep reinforcement learning. \n",
            "With all his works, Demis has achieved much recognition, including in 2013 as Listed on WIRED's 'Smart 50’, in 2017 as Time 100: The 100 Most Influential People, and in 2020 as The 50 Most Influential People in Britain from British GQ magazine.\n",
            "From his passion, he keeps working on what he loves and turning it into an advancement for the whole world. His inspiring story should drive us as well to achieve what we want.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "This article has discussed inspiring stories from three AI leaders: Andrew Ng, Fei-Fei Li, and Demis Hassabis. They might be a leader now, but everyone comes from somewhere, which was inspiring.\n",

            "Text:   Having spent many years working on AI research and building AI products, I’m fortunate to have participated in a few innovations that made an impact, like using reinforcement learning to fly helicopter drones at Stanford, starting and leading Google Brain to drive large-scale deep learning, and creating online courses that led to the founding of Coursera. I’d like to share some thoughts about how to do it well, sidestep some of the pitfalls, and avoid building things that lead to serious harm along the way. AI is a dominant driver of innovation today As I have said before, I believe AI is the new electricity. Electricity revolutionized all industries and changed our way of life, and AI is doing the same. It’s reaching into every industry and discipline, and it’s yielding advances that help multitudes of people.\n",
            "AI—like electricity—is a general-purpose technology. Many innovations, such as a medical treatment, space rocket, or battery design, are fit for one purpose. In contrast, AI is useful for generating art, serving web pages that are relevant to a search query, optimizing shipping routes to save fuel, helping cars avoid collisions, and much more.  The advance of AI creates opportunities for everyone in all corners of the economy to explore whether or how it applies to their area. Thus, learning about AI creates disproportionately many opportunities to do something that no one else has ever done before.\n",
            "For instance, at AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, I’ve been privileged to participate in projects that apply AI to maritime shipping, relationship coaching, talent management, education, and other areas. Because many AI technologies are new, their application to most domains has not yet been explored. In this way, knowing how to take advantage of AI gives you numerous opportunities to collaborate with others.  Looking ahead, a few developments are especially exciting.   Prompting: While ChatGPT has popularized the ability to prompt an AI model to write, say, an email or a poem, software developers are just beginning to understand that prompting enables them to build in minutes the types of powerful AI applications that used to take months. A massive wave of AI applications will be built this way.    Vision transformers: Text transformers—language models based on the transformer neural network architecture, which was invented in 2017 by Google Brain and collaborators—have revolutionized writing. Vision transformers, which adapt transformers to computer vision tasks such as recognizing objects in images, were introduced in 2020 and quickly gained widespread attention. The buzz around vision transformers in the technical community today reminds me of the buzz around text transformers a couple of years before ChatGPT. A similar revolution is coming to image processing. Visual prompting, in which the prompt is an image rather than a string of text, will be part of this change.   AI applications: The press has given a lot of attention to AI’s hardware and software infrastructure and developer tools. But this emerging AI infrastructure won’t succeed unless even more valuable AI businesses are built on top of it. So even though a lot of media attention is on the AI infrastructure layer, there will be even more growth in the AI application layer.   These areas offer rich opportunities for innovators. Moreover, many of them are within reach of broadly tech-savvy people, not just people already in AI. Online courses, open-source software, software as a service, and online research papers give everyone tools to learn and start innovating. But even if these technologies aren’t yet within your grasp, many other paths to innovation are wide open. Be optimistic, but dare to fail  That said, a lot of ideas that initially seem promising turn out to be duds. Duds are unavoidable if you take innovation seriously. Here are some projects of mine that you probably haven’t heard of, because they were duds:     I spent a long time trying to get aircraft to fly autonomously in formation to save fuel (similar to birds that fly in a V formation). In hindsight, I executed poorly and should have worked with much larger aircraft. I tried to get a robot arm to unload dishwashers that held dishes of all different shapes and sizes. In hindsight, I was much too early. Deep-learning algorithms for perception and control weren’t good enough at the time.   About 15 years ago, I thought that unsupervised learning (that is, enabling machine-learning models to learn from unlabeled data) was a promising approach. I mistimed this idea as well. It’s finally working, though, as the availability of data and computational power has grown.  It was painful when these projects didn’t succeed, but the lessons I learned turned out to be instrumental for other projects that fared better. Through my failed attempt at V-shape flying, I learned to plan projects much better and front-load risks. The effort to unload dishwashers failed, but it led my team to build the Robot Operating System (ROS), which became a popular open-source framework that’s now in robots from self-driving cars to mechanical dogs. Even though my initial focus on unsupervised learning was a poor choice, the steps we took turned out to be critical in scaling up deep learning at Google Brain.   Society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism.   Innovation has never been easy. When you do something new, there will be skeptics. In my younger days, I faced a lot of skepticism when starting most of the projects that ultimately proved to be successful. But this is not to say the skeptics are always wrong. I faced skepticism for most of the unsuccessful projects as well. As I became more experienced, I found that more and more people would agree with whatever I said, and that was even more worrying. I had to actively seek out people who would challenge me and tell me the truth. Luckily, these days I am surrounded by people who will tell me when they think I’m doing something dumb!  While skepticism is healthy and even necessary, society has a deep interest in the fruits of innovation. And that is a good reason to approach innovation with optimism. I’d rather side with the optimist who wants to give it a shot and might fail than the pessimist who doubts what’s possible. \n",
            "Take responsibility for your work As we focus on AI as a driver of valuable innovation throughout society, social responsibility is more important than ever. People both inside and outside the field see a wide range of possible harms AI may cause. These include both short-term issues, such as bias and harmful applications of the technology, and long-term risks, such as concentration of power and potentially catastrophic applications. It’s important to have open and intellectually rigorous conversations about them. In that way, we can come to an agreement on what the real risks are and how to reduce them. Over the past millennium, successive waves of innovation have reduced infant mortality, improved nutrition, boosted literacy, raised standards of living worldwide, and fostered civil rights including protections for women, minorities, and other marginalized groups. Yet innovations have also contributed to climate change, spurred rising inequality, polarized society, and increased loneliness.    Clearly, the benefits of innovation come with risks, and we have not always managed them wisely. AI is the next wave, and we have an obligation to learn lessons from the past to maximize future benefits for everyone and minimize harm. This will require commitment from both individuals and society at large.  At the social level, governments are moving to regulate AI. To some innovators, regulation may look like an unnecessary restraint on progress. I see it differently. Regulation helps us avoid mistakes and enables new benefits as we move into an uncertain future. I welcome regulation that calls for more transparency into the opaque workings of large tech companies; this will help us understand their impact and steer them toward achieving broader societal benefits. Moreover, new regulations are needed because many existing ones were written for a pre-AI world. The new regulations should specify the outcomes we want in important areas like health care and finance—and those we do not want.    But avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator. As technologists, we have a responsibility to understand the implications of our research and innovate in ways that are beneficial. Traditionally, many technologists adopted the attitude that the shape technology takes is inevitable and there’s nothing we can do about it, so we might as well innovate freely. But we know that’s not true.    Avoiding harm shouldn’t be just a priority for society. It also needs to be a priority for each innovator.    When innovators choose to work on differential privacy (which allows AI to learn from data without exposing personally identifying information), they make a powerful statement that privacy matters. That statement helps shape the social norms adopted by public and private institutions. Conversely, when innovators create Web3 cryptographic protocols to launder money, that too creates a powerful statement—in my view, a harmful one—that governments should not be able to trace how funds are transferred and spent.  If you see something unethical being done, I hope you’ll raise it with your colleagues and supervisors and engage them in constructive conversations. And if you are asked to work on something that you don’t think helps humanity, I hope you’ll actively work to put a stop to it. If you are unable to do so, then consider walking away. At AI Fund, I have killed projects that I assessed to be financially sound but ethically unsound. I urge you to do the same.  Now, go forth and innovate! If you’re already in the innovation game, keep at it. There’s no telling what great accomplishment lies in your future. If your ideas are in the daydream stage, share them with others and get help to shape them into something practical and successful. Start executing, and find ways to use the power of innovation for good.   This essay is part of MIT Technology Review’s 2023 Innovators Under 35 package. Meet this year’s honorees.   Andrew Ng is a renowned global AI innovator. He leads AI Fund, DeepLearning.AI, and Landing AI.   \n",

I hardly think so, as AI has started complementing how we live. The breakthrough of AI into everyday life did not happen suddenly; instead, it was intentional by some individuals. Many of these individuals are what we refer to as the leaders in AI.\n",

As the founder of Coursera, which taught millions of individuals, he could be considered an inspirational leader in AI and a legend. But, many behind-the-scenes moments make him so revered.\n",
            "Andrew graduated at the top of his undergraduate class in 1997, majoring in three degrees: Statistics, economics, and computer science. From 1996 to 1998, he focuses his research at AT&T Bell Labs on reinforcement learning, feature selection, and model selection. His research started to become renowned in 1998 when he built an automatically indexed web search engine for machine learning research papers on the web.\n",

I’d like to share some thoughts about how to do it well, sidestep some of the pitfalls, and avoid building things that lead to serious harm along the way. AI is a dominant driver of innovation today As I have said before, I believe AI is the new electricity. Electricity revolutionized all industries and changed our way of life, and AI is doing the same. It’s reaching into every industry and discipline, and it’s yielding advances that help multitudes of people.\n",
            "AI—like electricity—is a general-purpose technology. Many innovations, such as a medical treatment, space rocket, or battery design, are fit for one purpose. In contrast, AI is useful for generating art, serving web pages that are relevant to a search query, optimizing shipping routes to save fuel, helping cars avoid collisions, and much more.  The advance of AI creates opportunities for everyone in all corners of the economy to explore whether or how it applies to their area. Thus, learning about AI creates disproportionately many opportunities to do something that no one else has ever done before.\n",
            "For instance, at AI Fund, a venture studio that I lead, I’ve been privileged to participate in projects that apply AI to maritime shipping, relationship coaching, talent management, education, and other areas.

You can read the rest of our series<strong> <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/tag/whats-next-in-tech/\">here</a></strong>.</em></p> <p>This time last year we did something reckless. In an industry where nothing stands still, we had a go at predicting the future. </p> </div><div> <p>How did we do? Our <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/23/1065852/whats-next-for-ai/\">four big bets for 2023</a> were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/30/1082678/three-things-to-know-about-the-white-houses-executive-order-on-ai/\">executive order came out in October</a> and the European Union’s AI Act <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/11/1084942/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-eus-new-ai-act/\">was finally agreed in December</a>); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups (half right: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/12/1072950/open-source-ai-google-openai-eleuther-meta/\">the open-source boom</a> continues, but AI companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind still stole the limelight); and that AI would change big pharma for good (too soon to tell: the AI revolution in drug discovery <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development/\">is in full swing</a>, but the first drugs developed using AI are still some years from market).</p> <p>Now we’re doing it again.</p>\n",
            "</div><div> <p>We decided to ignore the obvious. We know that large language models will continue to dominate. Regulators will grow bolder. AI’s problems—from bias to copyright to doomerism—will shape the agenda for researchers, regulators, and the public, not just in 2024 but for years to come. (Read more about our six big questions for generative AI <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/19/1084505/generative-ai-artificial-intelligence-bias-jobs-copyright-misinformation/\">here</a>.)</p> <p>Instead, we’ve picked a few more specific trends. Here’s what to watch out for in 2024. (Come back next year and check how we did.)</p>\n",
            "<h3>1</h3> <h4>Customized chatbots</h4> <p>You get a chatbot! And you get a chatbot! In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products. To do this, AI giants Google and OpenAI are betting big on going small: both are developing user-friendly platforms that allow people to customize powerful language models and make their own mini chatbots that cater to their specific needs—no coding skills required. Both have launched web-based tools that allow anyone to become a generative-AI app developer. </p> <p>In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4 and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/06/1084471/google-deepminds-new-gemini-model-looks-amazing-but-could-signal-peak-ai-hype/\">Gemini</a>, are multimodal, meaning they can process not only text but images and even videos. This new capability could unlock a whole bunch of new apps. For example, a real estate agent can upload text from previous listings, fine-tune a powerful model to generate similar text with just a click of a button, upload videos and photos of new listings, and simply ask the customized AI to generate a description of the property. </p> <p>But of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/22/1070167/these-news-tool-let-you-see-for-yourself-how-biased-ai-image-models-are/\">riddled with biases</a>. They are also <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/03/1070893/three-ways-ai-chatbots-are-a-security-disaster/\">easy to hack</a>, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems. </p> <p><em>—Melissa Heikkil</em><em>ä</em></p> </div><div> <div> <figure><p>STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO</p> </figure> </div> <h3>2</h3> <h4>Generative AI’s second wave will be video</h4> <p>It’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/16/1065005/generative-ai-revolution-art/\"> exploded into the mainstream in 2022</a>—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html\"> prize-winning art</a>. But it’s not all good fun: for every<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/25/1052695/dark-secret-cute-ai-animal-images-dalle-openai-imagen-google/\"> pug waving pompoms</a>, there’s another piece of<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\"> knock-off fantasy art</a> or<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/12/1064751/the-viral-ai-avatar-app-lensa-undressed-me-without-my-consent/\"> sexist sexual stereotyping</a>.</p> <p>The new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it.</p> <p>A year ago we got the<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/29/1060472/meta-text-to-video-ai/\"> first glimpse</a> of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/06/1067897/runway-stable-diffusion-gen-1-generative-ai-for-video/\">Runway</a>, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called<a href=\"https://research.runwayml.com/gen2\"> Gen-2</a>, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The<a href=\"https://twitter.com/c_valenzuelab/status/1730692112276987970\"> best clips</a> aren’t far off what Pixar might put out.</p>\n",
            "<p>Runway has set up an annual<a href=\"https://aiff.runwayml.com/\"> AI film festival</a> that showcases<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/01/1073858/surreal-ai-generative-video-changing-film/\"> experimental movies</a> made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles.</p> <p>It’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em> starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.  </p> <p>Away from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies. </p> <p>The ability to do so much with so little <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/19/1081974/meta-realeyes-artificial-intelligence-hollywood-actors-strike/\">raises serious questions for actors</a>. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell &amp; Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.</p> </div><div> <p><em>—Will Douglas Heaven</em></p> <h3>3</h3> <h4>AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere </h4> <p>If recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/americas/argentina-election-ai-milei-massa.html\">Argentina</a>, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-04/deepfakes-in-slovakia-preview-how-ai-will-change-the-face-of-elections?sref=E9Urfma4\">Slovakia</a>, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/us/politics/trump-meme-trolls-2024.html\">cheered on</a> a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes. </p> </div><div> <p>While it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences.</p> <p>Just a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/11/01/israel-gaza-adobe-artificial-intelligence-images-fake-news/\">flooded</a> stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s. </p>\n",
            "<p>The coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/29/1078620/google-deepmind-has-launched-a-watermarking-tool-for-ai-generated-images/\">Google DeepMind’s SynthID</a>, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news. </p> <p><em>—Melissa Heikkil</em><em>ä</em></p>\n",
            "<div> <figure><p>STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO</p> </figure> </div> <h3>4</h3> <h3>Robots that multitask</h3> <p>Inspired by some of the core techniques behind generative AI’s current boom, roboticists are starting to build more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks.</p> <p>The last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones.</p> </div><div><p>The same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023.</p> <p>In June, DeepMind released<a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent/\"> Robocat</a> (an update on last year’s<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/23/1052627/deepmind-gato-ai-model-hype/\"> Gato</a>), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical). </p> <p>In October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a<a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/scaling-up-learning-across-many-different-robot-types/\"> big new general-purpose training data set</a>, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech.</p> <p>The problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to.</p>\n",
            "<p><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/12/1078360/lerrel-pinto-home-robots-ai/\">Lerrel Pinto</a> at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/14/1085231/new-system-teach-robot-household-task/\"> iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker</a>. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/14/1037043/facebook-machine-learning-ai-vision-see-world-human-eyes/\"> Meta’s Ego4D</a>.</p> <p>This approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/27/1052826/ai-reinforcement-learning-self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles-wayve-waabi-cruise/\"> new wave of self-driving AI</a> that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost.</p> <p><em>—Will Douglas Heaven</em> </p></div></div></div>||||I||||You need to enable JavaScript to view this site.\n",

(Read more about our six big questions for generative AI here.)\n",

            " You get a chatbot! And you get a chatbot! In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products. To do this, AI giants Google and OpenAI are betting big on going small: both are developing user-friendly platforms that allow people to customize powerful language models and make their own mini chatbots that cater to their specific needs—no coding skills required. Both have launched web-based tools that allow anyone to become a generative-AI app developer.\n",
            "\n",
            " In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, are multimodal, meaning they can process not only text but images and even videos. This new capability could unlock a whole bunch of new apps. For example, a real estate agent can upload text from previous listings, fine-tune a powerful model to generate similar text with just a click of a button, upload videos and photos of new listings, and simply ask the customized AI to generate a description of the property.\n",
            "\n",
            " But of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are riddled with biases. They are also easy to hack, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems.\n",

Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to prize-winning art.

            " Away from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too.

            " The last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones.\n",
            "\n",
            " The same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023.\n",
            "\n",
            " In June, DeepMind released Robocat (an update on last year’s Gato), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical).\n",
            "\n",
            " In October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a big new general-purpose training data set, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech.\n",
            "\n",
            " The problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to.\n",
            "\n",
            " Lerrel Pinto at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as Meta’s Ego4D.\n",

            " This approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a new wave of self-driving AI that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost.\n",

Advancements in AI, especially generative AI (GenAI), are leading to a once-in-a-generation shift. This is opening vast new opportunities and transforming industries, modes of operation, and career paths.</p>\n",

What will it take for organizations to adopt and integrate AI? How can innovators leverage change to remain competitive? Where and how will innovation and trust intersect?</p>\n",
            "<p>These insights and questions have inspired my predictions for coming tech trends in 2024.</p>\n",
            "<h3><strong><em>1. GenAI will fast expand into the business world with GenAI-powered NLIs, customized LLMs, tailored B2B applications and business context.</em></strong></h3>\n",
            "<p>Natural language interfaces (NLIs) powered by GenAI will be expected for new products and more than half will have this by default by the end of 2024. GenAI will also be leveraged in B2B interactions with users demanding more contextualized, personalized, and integrated solutions. GenAI will offer APIs, interfaces, and services to access, analyze, and visualize data and insights, becoming pervasive across areas such as project management, software quality and testing, compliance assessments, and recruitment efforts. As a result, observability for AI will grow.</p>\n",
            "<p>We will also see the rise of specialized, domain-specific AI models and a shift to smaller, specialized LLMs with higher levels of accuracy, relevancy, precision and niche domain understanding. For instance, LLaMA-7B models – often used for code completion and few-shotting – will see increasing adoption. Moreover, multi-modality combination of various data types such as images, text, speech, and numerical with intelligence processing algorithms will expand B2B use cases. This will result in better results in areas such as business planning, medicine, and financial services.</p>\n",
            "<h3><strong><em>2. A movement for responsible, ethical use of AI will begin with clear AI governance frameworks that respect human rights and values.</em></strong></h3>\n",
            "<p>Adoption of AI is a once-in-a-generation technology shift and it is sitting at the intersection of innovation and trust. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/solutions/ai/readiness-index.html#blade_introduction\">76% of organizations</a> don’t have comprehensive AI policies in place. There is mostly general agreement that we need regulations/policy and industry self-policing and governance to mitigate the risks from GenAI. However, we need to get more nuanced, for example, in areas like IP infringement, where bits of existing works of original art are scraped to generate new digital art. This area needs regulation.</p>\n",

With the rising importance of AI systems, available public data will soon hit a ceiling and high-quality language data will likely be exhausted before 2026. Organizations need to shift to private and/or synthetic data which opens the possibility for unintended access and usage.</p>\n",
            "<p>There is plenty that organizations can do on their own. Leaders must commit to transparency and trustworthiness around the development, use, and outcomes of AI systems. For instance, in reliability, addressing false content and unanticipated outcomes should be driven by organizations with RAI assessments, robust training of LLMs to reduce the chance of hallucinations, sentiment analysis and output shaping. In 2024, we will see companies of every size and sector formally outline how responsible AI governance guides internal development, application, and use of AI. Until tech companies can credibly show they are trustworthy, you can anticipate governments creating more policies.</p>\n",
            "<h3><strong><em>3. Consumers and companies will face increased risks from AI-generated disinformation, scams, and fraud, prompting tech companies and governments to work together for solutions.</em></strong></h3>\n",
            "<p>In 2024, AI-enabled disinformation, scams, and fraud will continue to grow as a threat to businesses, people, and even candidates and elections.

            " Liz Centoni\n",
            "\n",
            " Technology continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace and predictions about coming trends are always a topic of debate – what’s real, what’s hype.\n",
            "\n",
            " While there’s always a wave of excitement around the next big thing, I think the last year has been different. Advancements in AI, especially generative AI (GenAI), are leading to a once-in-a-generation shift. This is opening vast new opportunities and transforming industries, modes of operation, and career paths.\n",
            "\n",
            " Not surprisingly this year, I’ve got lots on AI with predictions that are filled with “Automated Inspiration.”\n",
            "\n",
            " The Cisco AI Readiness Index revealed that 95% of respondents have an AI strategy in place or under development, but only 14% are fully ready to integrate AI into their business. What will it take for organizations to adopt and integrate AI? How can innovators leverage change to remain competitive? Where and how will innovation and trust intersect?\n",
            "\n",
            " These insights and questions have inspired my predictions for coming tech trends in 2024.\n",
            "\n",
            " 1. GenAI will fast expand into the business world with GenAI-powered NLIs, customized LLMs, tailored B2B applications and business context.\n",
            "\n",
            " Natural language interfaces (NLIs) powered by GenAI will be expected for new products and more than half will have this by default by the end of 2024. GenAI will also be leveraged in B2B interactions with users demanding more contextualized, personalized, and integrated solutions. GenAI will offer APIs, interfaces, and services to access, analyze, and visualize data and insights, becoming pervasive across areas such as project management, software quality and testing, compliance assessments, and recruitment efforts. As a result, observability for AI will grow.\n",
            "\n",
            " We will also see the rise of specialized, domain-specific AI models and a shift to smaller, specialized LLMs with higher levels of accuracy, relevancy, precision and niche domain understanding. For instance, LLaMA-7B models – often used for code completion and few-shotting – will see increasing adoption. Moreover, multi-modality combination of various data types such as images, text, speech, and numerical with intelligence processing algorithms will expand B2B use cases. This will result in better results in areas such as business planning, medicine, and financial services.\n",
            "\n",
            " 2. A movement for responsible, ethical use of AI will begin with clear AI governance frameworks that respect human rights and values.\n",
            "\n",
            " Adoption of AI is a once-in-a-generation technology shift and it is sitting at the intersection of innovation and trust. Yet, 76% of organizations don’t have comprehensive AI policies in place. There is mostly general agreement that we need regulations/policy and industry self-policing and governance to mitigate the risks from GenAI. However, we need to get more nuanced, for example, in areas like IP infringement, where bits of existing works of original art are scraped to generate new digital art. This area needs regulation.\n",
            "\n",
            " We must also ensure that consumers have access to and control over their data in the spirit of the recent EU Data Act. With the rising importance of AI systems, available public data will soon hit a ceiling and high-quality language data will likely be exhausted before 2026. Organizations need to shift to private and/or synthetic data which opens the possibility for unintended access and usage.\n",
            "\n",
            " There is plenty that organizations can do on their own. Leaders must commit to transparency and trustworthiness around the development, use, and outcomes of AI systems. For instance, in reliability, addressing false content and unanticipated outcomes should be driven by organizations with RAI assessments, robust training of LLMs to reduce the chance of hallucinations, sentiment analysis and output shaping. In 2024, we will see companies of every size and sector formally outline how responsible AI governance guides internal development, application, and use of AI. Until tech companies can credibly show they are trustworthy, you can anticipate governments creating more policies.\n",
            "\n",
            " 3. Consumers and companies will face increased risks from AI-generated disinformation, scams, and fraud, prompting tech companies and governments to work together for solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            " In 2024, AI-enabled disinformation, scams, and fraud will continue to grow as a threat to businesses, people, and even candidates and elections. In response, we’ll see more investments in detection and risk mitigation. Inclusive new AI solutions will guard against cloned voices, deepfakes, social media bots, and influence campaigns. AI models will be trained on large datasets for better accuracy and effectiveness. New mechanisms for authentication and provenance will promote transparency and accountability.\n",
            "\n",
            " In keeping with the G7 Guiding Principles on AI regarding threats to democratic values, the Biden administration’s Safe AI Executive Order, and the EU AI Act, we’ll also see more collaboration between the private sector and governments to raise threat awareness and implement verification and security measures. We’ll see cooperation to sanction rogue actors and ensure regulatory compliance. Businesses must prioritize advanced threat detection and data protection, regular vulnerability assessments, updating security systems, and thorough audits of network infrastructures.

Its usage (ethical or non-ethical) is with the user including ‘defining what is ethical and non-ethical’. While self-governance is complimented by legal support, the industry would embrace AI (in all forms) soon. The newfound interest (obsession?) with AI (stretched automation?) is truly ‘once-in-a-generation’ idea!

            "In the past twelve months, AI, and especially generative AI, has captured the mainstream imagination. We have seen both great optimism and great anxiety about which doors to the future AI can open. Looking forward into 2024, this optimism and concern will continue to both intensify and broaden, as new uses of AI manifest in the ways that we work and live.\n",
            "As both an academic and an AI Observability software executive, here are the major trends that I see taking shape: \n",
            " 1. RAG apps are going to cross the chasm from experimentation to production \n",
            "Applications that leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), an AI framework for improving responses by grounding a model on external knowledge sources, generated significant excitement last year and were the most popular types of app for experimentation. We saw many use cases in customer service, product support, marketing, and more. However, many of these uses cases were often only experiments, used by forward-thinking researchers and developers to build skills or test out case examples. In 2024, we are already seeing signs of growing confidence in RAG app development, as well as app testing and evaluation, to move more of these apps into a production environment.\n",
            " 2. LLM agents are going to become more reliable \n",
            "Another use case gaining rapid traction is LLM-powered agents. Agents are a system that can use an LLM to reason through a problem, create an approach to address the problem, and then execute that plan with the help of tools. They can be used to create a question answering app that, for example, could answer more complex questions about things like the specific results of a public company’s quarterly financial statement and how it compared to prior quarters.  Due to their higher complexity, agent-based apps often struggled with reliability issues. As tools become more sophisticated in terms of providing feedback to those apps, they will increase their ability to consistently answer complex questions.\n",
            " 3. Multi-modal models and apps are going to become mainstream \n",
            "Chat GPT works in the single mode of text. Midjourney works in the mode of images. Multimodal AI systems train with and make use of a variety of inputs and outputs, including numerical data sets, video, audio, speech, images, and text. While multi-modal AI is rudimentary today and requires massive computational power, it holds great promise. In manufacturing, it could potentially oversee and optimize manufacturing processes. In healthcare, it could improve diagnosis through taking into account a variety of patient data. As rapid advancement occurs across each mode of AI, multi-modal AI will become easier to implement.\n",
            " 4. Enterprises will adopt a multi-provider strategy for GenAI \n",
            "While the foundation model providers such as OpenAI and Google Vertex AI are competing in hopes of becoming the sole provider of Gen AI tools to organizations, we are already seeing companies pick and choose their providers carefully, based on use case. Enterprises are often carefully weighing strengths and weaknesses, to take a best of breed approach to the AI engine powering their apps. This also provides appropriate risk management, ensuring that they are not overdependent on any one vendor.  Tools that help enterprises to achieve this multi-provider strategy will likely see strong success in the coming year.\n",
            " 5.  Governance will become a key consideration for GenAI adoption  \n",
            "President Biden’s signing of the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence on October 30th changed the game, as it put forth a coordinated, federal government-wide approach toward Responsible AI. The EO focuses heavily on testing, auditing, and reporting, with forthcoming additional impact coming from an array of technical standard-setting and guidance to be determined over the next year. Such standards will intentionally influence the development and use of AI  in the private sector.\n",
            "The United States is not the only source of Responsible AI momentum. The European Commission finalized its Artificial Intelligence Act in December. This will set into motion the evolution of processes, resources, and technology stacks to accommodate the need to demonstrate AI quality and transparency, such as demonstrating fairness in automated credit lending or hiring.\n",
            "We are already seeing companies move quickly to set up the appropriate testing and guardrails to ensure that they can both develop effective AI apps as well as meet regulatory guidelines.\n",
            "The coming year will likely be one of great growth – in AI use cases, in the AI toolset, and the AI tech stack. With great change comes great opportunity, and we look forward to seeing a flourishing of creativity and innovation in the year to come.\n",

            "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",
