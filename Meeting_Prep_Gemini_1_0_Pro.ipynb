            " MIT Technologies presents 35 brilliant young entrepreneurs, inventors, visionaries, humanitarians and pioneers who are working to make the world a better place. The list '35 Innovators Under 35' represents young people who are looking for ways to use technology to help people. Andrej Karpathy entered this list, in the nomination pioneer. Andrej Karpathy is the director of artificial intelligence and Autopilot Vision at Tesla, specializing in deep learning and image recognition and understanding. Using his achievements, Tesla goes a different way than most other automakers. Many computer scientists have been trying to teach computers to see for decades. But none of them was as successful as Karpathy. He developed an approach to deep neural networks that allows machines to make sense of what is happening in images. \n",
            "   As a graduate student at Stanford, Karpathy extended techniques for building what are known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) —systems that broadly mimic the neuron structure in the visual cortex. (In 2015 he also designed and was the primary instructor for the first deep-learning class at Stanford.) By combining CNNs with other deep-learning approaches, he created a system that was not just better at recognizing individual items in images (say, a dog or a person), but capable of seeing an entire scene full of objects — multiple dogs and people interacting with each other — and effectively building a story of what was happening in it and what might happen next. Karpathy became a member of the Tesla team in 2017, now he oversees neural networks for the cars’ Autopilot feature. Tesla Autopilot is qualitatively different from others. Typically, cars with automatic control scan the environment using expensive laser rangefinders, create a virtual map, and then use the AI ​​to decide what to do. Tesla uses traditional cameras instead. \n",
            "  Source: Matroid/YouTube \n",
            " Karpathy method lets the car spot objects in the road as a human driver would, and it can take in the entire scene (cars, people, intersections, stop signs, and more) and — if it works as intended — instantly infer what's taking place. Doing so requires nearly 50 neural networks to constantly process data coming in as the more than a million cars in the fleet look and learn. Karpathy is a bright representative of the talented people who make up the team that seeks to change the world for the better - the Tesla team. \n",

            "We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,179 customer support agents. Access to the tool increases productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 14 percent on average, with the greatest impact on novice and low-skilled workers, and minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers. We provide suggestive evidence that the AI model disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. In addition, we show that AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.\n",

            "deployment of a chat assistant using data from 5,000 agents working for a Fortune 500 software firm that provides business process software. The tool we study is built on a recent version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family of large language models developed by OpenAI (OpenAI, 2023) . It monitors customer chats and provides agents with real-time suggestions for how to respond. It is designed to augment agents, who remain responsible for the conversation and are free to ignore its suggestions.\n",
            "\n",
            "We have four sets of findings.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, AI assistance increases worker productivity, resulting in a 13.8 percent increase in the number of chats that an agent is able to successfully resolve per hour. This increase reflects shifts in three components of productivity: a decline in the time it takes to an agent to handle an individual chat, an increase in the number of chats that an agent is able to handle per hour (agents may handle multiple calls at once), and a small increase in the share of chats that are successfully resolved.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, AI assistance disproportionately increases the performance less skilled and less experienced workers across all productivity measures we consider. In addition, we find that the AI tool helps newer agents move more quickly down the experience curve: treated agents with two months of tenure perform just as well as untreated agents with over six months of tenure. These results contrast, in spirit, with studies that find evidence of skill-biased technical change for earlier waves of computer technology (Autor et al., 2003; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Bartel et al., 2007) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Our third set of results investigates the mechanism underlying our findings so far. We posit that high-skill workers may have less to gain from AI assistance precisely because AI recommendations capture the potentially tacit knowledge embodied in their own behaviors. Rather, low-skill workers are more likely to improve by incorporating these behaviors by adhering to AI suggestions. Consistent with this, we find few positive effects of AI access for the highest-skilled or most-experienced workers. Instead, using textual analysis, we find suggestive evidence that AI assistance leads lowerskill agents to communicate more like high-skill agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, we show that the introduction of AI systems can impact the experience and organization of work. We show that AI assistance markedly improves how customers treat agents, as measured by the sentiments of their chat messages. This change may be associated with other organizational changes: turnover decreases, particularly for newer workers, and customers are less likely to escalate a call by asking to speak to an agent's supervisor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our overall findings demonstrate that generative AI working alongside humans can have a significant positive impact on the productivity and retention of individual workers. We emphasize, however, that our paper is not designed to shed light on the aggregate employment or wage effects of generative AI tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our paper is related to a large literature on the impact of various forms of technological adoption on worker productivity and the organization of work (e.g. Rosen, 1981; Autor et al., 1998; Athey and Stern, 2002; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Bartel et al., 2007; Acemoglu et al., 2007; Hoffman et al., 2017; Bloom et al., 2014; Michaels et al., 2014; Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2015; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2020) . Many of these studies, particularly those focused on information technologies, find evidence that IT complements higher-skill workers (Akerman et al., 2015; Taniguchi and Yamada, 2022) . Bartel et al. (2007) shows that firms that adopt IT tend to use more skilled labor and increase skill requirements for their workers. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) study the diffusion of robots and find that the negative employment effects of robots are most pronounced for workers in blue-collar occupations and those with less than a college education. In contrast, we study a different type of technology-generative AI-and find evidence that it most effectively augments lower-skill workers.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, Peng et al. (2023b) recruit software engineers for a specific coding task (writing an HTTP server in JavaScript) and show that those given access to GitHub Copilot complete this task twice as quickly. Similarly, Noy and Zhang (2023) run an online experiment showing that subjects given access to ChatGPT complete professional writing tasks more quickly. In addition, they show that ChatGPT compresses the productivity distribution, with lower-skill workers benefiting the most.\n",
            "\n",
            "To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies of the impact of access to generative AI tools on productivity in real-world workplaces, nor over longer periods. Such studies are important because the impact of AI on productivity may vary over time and interact with workers' baseline level of experience or expertise. Technologies that look promising in laboratory settings may have more limited effects in practice because of the need for complementary organizational investments, skill development and business process redesign. In addition, the introduction of AI systems may have further impacts on worker and customer satisfaction, attrition, and patterns of organizational behavior.\n",

            "1 Generative AI and Large Language Models\n",
            "\n",
            "In recent years, the rapid pace of AI development and public release tools such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and DALL-E have attracted widespread attention, optimism, and alarm (The White House, 2022) . These technologies are all examples of \"generative AI,\" a class of machine learning technologies that can generate new content-such as text, images, music, or video-by analyzing patterns in existing data. In this section, we provide background on generative AI as a technology and discuss its potential economic implications.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.1 Technical Primer\n",
            "\n",
            "In this paper, we focus on an important class of generative AI, large language models (LLMs). At a high level, LLMs are neural network models designed to process sequential data (Bubeck et al., 2023) . For instance, an LLM can be trained by giving it access to a large corpus of text (such as Wikipedia, digitized books, or portions of the Internet) and using that input text to learn to predict the next word in a sequence, given what has come before. This knowledge of the statistical co-occurrence of words allows it to generate new text that is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though the name implies human language, the same techniques can be used to produce LLMs that generate other forms of sequential data such as protein sequences, audio, computer code, or chess moves (Eloundou et al., 2023) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Recent progress in generative AI has been driven by four factors: computing power, earlier innovations in model architecture, the ability to \"pre-train\" using large amounts of unlabeled data, and refinements in training techniques. 4 Model performance depends strongly on scale, which includes the amount of computing power used for training, the number of model parameters, and dataset size (Kaplan et al., 2020) . Pre-training an LLM requires thousands of GPUs and weeks to months of dedicated training time. For example, estimates indicate that a single training run for a GPT-3 model with 175 billion parameters, trained on 300 billion tokens, may cost $5 million dollars in just computing costs (Li, 2020; Brown et al., 2020) .\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of model architecture, modern LLMs make use of two earlier key innovations: positional encoding and self-attention. Positional encodings keep track of the order in which a word occurs in a given input.5 This allows large bodies of input text to be broken into smaller segments that can be processed simultaneously without \"forgetting\" earlier parts of the input (Vaswani et al., 2017; Bahdanau et al., 2015) . Meanwhile, self-attention assigns importance weights to each word in the context of the entire input text. Older approaches that assign importance based on word frequencies that may misrepresent a word's true semantic importance. These older methods may also base on semantic content within a small window. In contrast, self-attention enables models to capture long-range semantic relationships within an input text, even when that text is broken up and processed in parallel (Vaswani et al., 2017) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, LLMs can be pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled data. For instance, GPT is trained on unlabeled text data, allowing it to learn patterns in human language without explicit guidance (Radford and Narasimhan, 2018) . Because unlabeled data is far more prevalent than labeled data, this allows for LLMs to learn about natural language on a much larger training corpus (Brown et al., 2020) . The resulting model can be used in multiple applications because its training is not specific to a particular set of tasks.6 \n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, general-purpose LLMs can be further \"fine-tuned\" to generate output that matches the priorities of any specific setting (Ouyang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023) . For example, an LLM may generate several potential responses to a given query, but some of them may be factually incorrect or biased. To discipline this model, human evaluators can rank these outputs to train a reward function prioritizes some responses over others. Such refinements can significantly improve model quality but making a general-purpose model better suited to its specific application (Ouyang et al., 2022) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Together, these innovations have generated meaningful improvements in model performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) family of models, in particular, has attracted considerable media attention for their rapidly expanding capabilities.7 \n",
            "\n",
            "1.2 The Economic Impacts of Generative AI\n",
            "\n",
            "Computers have historically excelled at executing pre-programmed instructions, making them particularly effective at tasks that can be standardized and reduced to explicit rules (Autor, 2014) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, computerization has had a disproportionate impact on jobs that involve routine tasks, such as data entry, bookkeeping, and assembly line work, and reducing demand for workers performing \"routine\" tasks (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011) . At the same time, computerization has also increased the productivity of workers who possess complementary skills, such as programming, data analysis, and research. Together, these changes have contributed to increasing wage inequality in the United States and have been linked to a variety of organizational changes (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Autor et al., 2003; Michaels et al., 2014; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Baker and Hubbard, 2003) .\n",
            "\n",
            "In contrast, recent advances in AI, particularly those driven by generative AI, suggest that it is possible for LLMs to perform a variety of non-routine tasks such as software coding, persuasive writing, and graphic design (Bommasani et al., 2021; Eloundou et al., 2023) . For example, Copilot, an AI pair programmer that generates code suggestions for programmers, has achieved impressive performance on technical coding questions and generates an average of 46 percent of code among users (Nguyen and Nadi, 2022; Zhao, 2023) . Similarly, services like Elicit and Casetext use LLMs to find and summarize key information in legal documents or research, tasks that were previously considered non-routine (Elicit, 2023; Casetext, 2023) . Since many of these tasks are currently performed by workers who have either been insulated or benefited from prior waves of technology adoption, the expansion of generative AI has the potential to shift the relationship between technology, labor productivity, and inequality (The White House, 2022) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike traditional programming, generative AI does not require explicit instructions as inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Instead, it uses ML to mine vast amounts of human-generated data to recognize patterns, allowing it to generate, summarize, and make inferences based on those patterns. For instance, if prompted to provide a cover for a gothic novel, generative AI models will respond with an illustration that is moody; if asked to write an email denying an employee a raise, generative AI will respond with a note that is professional; this occurs even though no programmer has instructed the AI model as to what tone would be appropriate in a given context. The ability to behave \"appropriately\" cannot be reduced to a set of rules; instead people learn to do so from experience and apply unconscious rules in the process. The fact that generative AI models display such skills suggests that they have the potential to move past what has been termed \"Polanyi's Paradox,\" the idea that knowledge is difficult to codify because individuals perform many tasks they cannot articulate (Polanyi, 1966; Autor, 2014) .\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, LLMs have significant limitations. Popular LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT have been shown to produce false or misleading information in unpredictable ways. While these models often perform well on specific tasks in the lab, these concerns have raised questions about their ability to perform well in more complex real-world settings (Peng et al., 2023a) .\n",

            "2 Our Setting: LLMs for Customer Support\n",
            "\n",
            "2.1 Customer Support and Generative AI\n",
            "\n",
            "We study the impact of generative AI in the customer service industry, an area with one the highest surveyed rates of AI adoption. 8 Customer support interactions are important for maintaining a company's reputation and building strong customer relationships, yet as in many industries, there is substantial variation in worker productivity (Berg et al., 2018; Syverson, 2011) .\n",
            "\n",
            "Newer workers are also often less productive and require significant training. At the same time, turnover is high: industry estimates suggest that 60 percent of agents in contact centers9 leave each year, costing firms $10,000 to $20,000 dollars per agent (Buesing et al., 2020; Gretz and Jacobson, 2018) . To address these workforce challenges, the average supervisor spends at least 20 hours per week coaching lower-performing agents (Berg et al., 2018) . Faced with variable productivity, high turnover, and high training costs, firms are increasingly turning toward AI tools (Chui et al., 2021) .\n",
            "\n",
            "At a technical level, customer support is well-suited for current generative AI tools. From an AI's perspective, customer-agent conversations can be thought of as a series of pattern-matching problems in which one is looking for an optimal sequence of actions. When confronted with an issue such as \"I can't login,\" an AI/agent must identify which types of underlying problems are most likely to lead a customer to be unable to log in and think about which solutions typically resolve these problems (\"Can you check that caps lock is not on?\"). At the same time, they must be attuned to a customer's emotional response, making sure to use language that increases the likelihood that a customer will respond positively (\"that wasn't stupid of you at all! I always forget to check that too!\"). Because customer service conversations are widely recorded and digitized, pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned for customer service using many examples of both successfully and unsuccessfully resolved conversations.\n",

            "\n",
            "We work with a company that provides AI-based customer service support software (hereafter, the \"AI firm\") to study the deployment of their tool at one of their client firms, (hereafter, the \"data firm\").\n",
            "\n",
            "Our data firm is a Fortune 500 enterprise software company that specializes in business process software for small and medium-sized businesses in the United States. It employs a variety of chat-based technical support agents, both directly and through third-party firms. The majority of agents in our sample work from offices located in the Philippines, with a smaller group working in the United States and in other countries. Across locations, agents are engaged in a fairly uniform job: answering technical support questions from US-based small business owners.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chats are randomly assigned and support sessions are relatively lengthy, averaging 40 minutes with much of the conversation spent trying to diagnose the underlying technical problem. The job requires a combination of detailed product knowledge, problem-solving skills, and the ability to deal with frustrated customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our firm measures productivity using three metrics that are standard in the customer service industry: \"average handle time,\" the average length of time an agent takes to finish a chat; \"resolution rate,\" the share of conversations that the agent can successfully resolve; and \"net promoter score,\" (customer satisfaction), which are calculated by randomly surveying customers after a chat and calculating the percentage of customers who would recommend an agent minus the percentage who would not. A productive agent is one who is able to field customer chats quickly while maintaining a high-resolution rate and net promoter score.\n",
            "\n",
            "Across locations, agents are organized into teams with a manager that provides feedback and training to agents. Once per week, managers hold one-on-one feedback sessions with each agent.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, a manager might share the solution to a new software bug, explain the implication of a tax change, or suggest how to better manage customer frustration with technical issues. Agents work individually and the quality of their output does not directly affect others. Agents are paid an hourly wage and bonuses based on their performance relative to other agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.3 AI System Design\n",
            "\n",
            "The AI system we study uses a generative model system that combines a recent version of GPT with additional ML algorithms specifically fine-tuned to focus on customer service interactions. The system is further trained on a large set of customer-agent conversations that have been labeled with a variety of outcomes and characteristics: whether the call was successfully resolved, how long it took to handle the call, and whether the agent in charge of the call is considered a \"top\" performer by the data firm. The AI firm then uses these data to look for conversational patterns that are most predictive of call resolution and handle time.\n",
            "\n",
            "The AI firm further trains its model using a process similar in spirit to Ouyang et al. (2022) to prioritize agent responses that express empathy, surface appropriate technical documentation, and limit unprofessional language. This additional training mitigates some of concerns associated with relying on LLMs to generate text.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once deployed, the AI system generates two main types of outputs: 1) real-time suggestions for how agents should respond to customers and 2) links to the data firm's internal documentation for relevant technical issues. In both cases, recommendations are based on a history of the conversation.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, the correct response when a customer says \"I can't track my employee's hours during business trips\" depends on what version of the data firm's software the customer uses. Suppose the customer has previously mentioned that they are using the premium version. In that case, they should have access to remote mobile device timekeeping, meaning that the support agents need to diagnose and resolve a technical issue preventing the software from working. If, however, the customer stated that they are using the standard version, then the correct solution is for the customer to upgrade to the premium version in order to access this feature. Importantly, the AI system we study is designed to augment, rather than replace, human agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "The output is shown only to the agent, who has full discretion over whether to incorporate (fully or partially) the AI suggestions. This reduces the potential for output that is off-topic or incorrect to make its way into customer conversations. Furthermore, the system does not provide suggestions when it has insufficient training data for that situation (this occurs in a large minority of cases). In these situations, the agent must respond on their own. Finally, we observe that the AI model is trained on human-generated data in a setting where there is high variability in the abilities of individual agents. As a result, when the model identifies patterns that distinguish successful from unsuccessful calls, it is implicitly learning the differences that characterize high-versus low-skill workers. For example, top-performing agents are often more effective at diagnosing the underlying technical issue given a customer's problem description: in an internal study, our AI firm found that top performers start researching a solution twice as quickly as the average workers. An AI system, with access to many examples of diagnostic questions and eventual solutions, may be able to encode some of the \"best practices\" top-performing agents use. This suggests that an AI system may be able to more effectively share knowledge across workers both because it may capture tacit knowledge that was previously difficult for managers to articulate and because it can provide more real-time recommendations than a busy manager. 11 Indeed, AI recommendations can be thought of as expanding the marginal productivity of high-skill workers 10 For more on context tracking, see, for instance, Dunn et al. (2021) .\n",
            "\n",
            "11 By necessity, managers can only base their feedback on a small subset of the hundreds of conversations an agent conducts. And because managers are often pressed for time and may lack training, they may focus on a single metric (\"you need to solve problems faster\") rather than identifying strategies for how an agent could better approach a problem (\"you need to ask more questions at the beginning to diagnose the issue better.\") This type of coaching is ineffective and often counterproductive for employee engagement (Berg et al., 2018) .\n",
            "\n",
            "by encoding their conversational patterns and disseminating them to other workers. In our setting, high-skill workers are not compensated for these contributions.\n",

Figure 2 documents the progression of deployment among agents who are eventually treated. The bulk of the adoption occurs between November 2020 and February 2021.\n",

            "\n",
            "Table 1 provides details on sample characteristics, divided into three groups: agents who are never given access to the AI tool during our sample period (\"never treated\"), pre-AI observations for those who are eventually given access (\"treated, pre\"), and post-AI observations (\"treated, post\").\n",
            "\n",
            "In total, we observe the conversation text and outcomes associated with 3 million chats by 5,179 agents. Within this, we observe 1.2 million chats by 1,636 agents in the post-AI period. Most agents in our sample, 83 percent, are located outside the United States, primarily in the Philippines. For each agent, we observe their assigned manager, tenure, geographic location and firm information.\n",
            "\n",
            "To examine the impacts of this deployment, we construct several key variables, all aggregated to the agent-month level, which is our primary level of analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our primary measure of productivity is resolutions per hour (RPH), the number of chats that a worker is able to successfully resolve per hour. We consider this measure to be the most effective summary of a worker's productivity at the firm. An agent's RPH is determined by several factors: the average time it takes an agent to complete a conversation, the number of conversations they are able to handle per hour (accounting for multiple simultaneous conversations), and the share of conversations that are successfully resolved. We measure these individually as, respectively, average handle time (AHT), chats per hour (CPH), and resolution rate (RR). In addition, we also observe a measure of customer satisfaction through an agent's net promoter score (NPS), which is collected by the firm from post-call customer surveys.\n",
            "\n",
            "We observe these measures for different numbers of agents. In particular, we are able to reconstruct measures of average handle time and chats per hour from our chat level data. Therefore we observe AHT and CPH measures for all agents in our sample. Measures that involve an understanding of call quality-resolution rates, and customer satisfaction-are provided at the agent month level by our data firm. Because our data outsources most of its customer service functions, it does not have direct control over this information, which is kept by subcontracted firms. As a result, we observe resolution rates and net promoter scores for a subset of agents in our data. This, in turn, means that we only observe our omnibus productivity measure-resolutions per hour-for this smaller subset.\n",
            "\n",
            "Figure 3 plots the raw distributions of our outcomes for each of the never, pre-, and posttreatment subgroups. Several of our main results are readily visible in these raw data. In Panels A through D, we see that post-treatment agents have higher outcomes than both never-treated agents and pre-treatment agents. In Panel E, we see no discernible differences in surveyed customer satisfaction among pre-and post-AI groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "Focusing on our main productivity measure, Panel A of Figure 3 and Table 1 show that nevertreated agents resolve an average of 1.7 chats per hour whereas post-treatment agents resolve 2.5 chats per hour. Some of this difference may be due to differences in the initial section: treated agents have higher resolutions per hour prior to AI model deployment (2.0 chats) relative to never treated agents (1.7). This same pattern appears for other outcomes: chats per hour (Panel C) and resolution rates (Panel D). Panel B illustrates the clearest pattern with average handle times: both pre-treatment and never-treated agents had a similar distribution of average handle times, centered at 40 minutes but post-treatment agents have a lower average handle time of 35 minutes.\n",

Our main variable of interest is AI it , an indicator equal to one if agent i has access to AI recommendations at time t. All regressions include year-month fixed effects δ t to control for common, time-varying factors such as tax season or business quarter end. In our preferred specification, we also include controls for time-invariant agent-level fixed effects α i and time-varying agent tenure. Standard errors are clustered at the agent or agent-location level.\n",

For instance, workers may take time to adjust to using the AI system, in which case its impact in the first month may be smaller. Alternatively, the onboarding of later cohorts of agents may be smoother, so that their treatment effects may be larger.\n",

(2022) , Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) , and Sun and Abraham ( 2021), as well as using traditional two-way fixed effects OLS. (2020) , and Sun and Abraham (2021) .

For both outcomes, we find a substantial and immediate increase in productivity in the first month of deployment. This effect grows slightly in the second month and remains stable and persistent up to the end of our sample. In Table 3 , we report additional results using our preferred specification with year-month, agent, and agent tenure fixed effects. Column 1 documents a 3.8 minute decrease in the average duration of customer chats, a 9 percent decline from the baseline mean (shorter handle times are generally considered better). Next, Column 2 indicates a 0.37 unit increase in the number of chats that an agent can handle per hour. Relative to a baseline mean of 2.6, this represents a roughly 14 percent increase. Unlike average handle time, chats per hour accounts for the possibility that agents may handle multiple chats simultaneously. The fact that we find a stronger effect on this outcome suggests that AI enables agents to both speed up chats and to multitask more effectively.\n",

Finally, Column 4 finds no economically significant change in customer satisfaction, as measured by net promoter scores: the coefficient is -0.13 percentage points and the mean is 79.6 percent.

These skill quintiles are defined within a firm-month. In Panel A, we show that the productivity impact of AI assistance is most pronounced for workers in the lowest skill quintile (leftmost side), who see a 35 percent increase in resolutions per hour. In contrast, AI assistance does not lead to any productivity increase for the most skilled workers (rightmost side).\n",

For the highest-skilled workers, we find mixed results: a zero effect on average handle time (Panel A), a positive effect for calls per hour (Panel B), and, interestingly, small but statistically significant decreases in resolution rates and customer satisfaction (Panels C and D). These findings suggest that while lower-skill workers improve from having access to AI recommendations, they may distract the highest-skilled workers, who are already doing their jobs effectively.\n",

Starting in month five, however, these workers gain access and we see their productivity rapidly increase following the same trajectory as the always-treated agents. In Appendix Taken together, these results indicate that access to AI helps new agents move more quickly down the experience curve.

In fact, the share of recommendations followed is similar to the share of other publicly reported numbers for generative AI tools; a study of GitHub Copilot reports that individual developers use 27 to 46 percent of code recommendations (Zhao, 2023) .

It calculates the cosine of the angle between two ndimensional vectors, where values close to 1 indicate similarity (Koroteev, 2021) . We form our text embeddings using all-MiniLM-L6-v2, an LLM that is specifically intended to capture and cluster semantic information in order to assess similarity (Hugging Face, 2023). We then compare how an agent's conversations change over time (e.g. within-person similarity over time), as well as how highand low-skill agents' conversations compare with each other over time (between-person similarity at a given point in time).\n",

We exclude the three weeks around deployment to account for disruptions due to training and individual adjustment to the AI model. We exclude messages from the customer, and focus only on agent-generated language. Then, for each individual agent, we plot textual dissimilarity between pre-and post-AI conversations as one minus the cosine similarity. The within-person textual difference in our data is roughly 0.3, indicating that, on average, agents continue to communicate similarly after the deployment of the AI model. For context, the sentences \"Can you help me with this logging in?\" and \"Why is my login not working?\" have a cosine similarity of 0.68.\n",

In Panel A of Figure 12 , we find evidence consistent with this hypothesis: initially lower-skill agents shift their language more after AI model deployment, relative to initially higher-skill workers. The scores we plot include controls for conversation timing to account for seasonal changes in topics such as tax season or payroll cycles. These results also control for agent tenure to account for the possibility that younger workers' language may evolve more quickly independent of access to the AI model.\n",
            "\n",
            "If AI assistance merely leads workers to type the same things but faster, then we would not expect this differential change. And because chats are randomly allocated to agents, we would not also expect the pattern we document to be driven by differential changes in conversation topics between high and low-skill workers.\n",

            "\n",
            "We next explore how lower-skill agents' language choices change with AI assistance. In Panel B of Figure 12 , we provide suggestive evidence that AI assistance leads lower-skill agents to communicate more like high-skill agents. In particular, we plot the cosine similarity between high-and low-skill agents at specific moments in calendar time, separately for workers with (blue dots) and without (red diamonds) access to AI assistance. Among agents without access, we define high-and low-skill agents as those who are in the top or bottom quintile of our skill index for that month. Among agents with access, we define high-and low-skill agents based on whether they are in the top or bottom quintile of skill at the time of deployment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Focusing on the blue dots, we see that the average textual similarity between high-and lowproductivity workers is 0.55. This figure is lower than our average within-person text similarity (0.73), which makes sense given that these are across-person comparisons. Textual similarity is stable over time, suggesting that high-and low-skill workers are not trending differently in the absence of the AI assistant. Turning to the red diamonds, post-AI, the textual similarity between high-and low-skill workers increases.\n",
            "\n",
            "Combined with our results from Panel A, this suggests that low-skill workers are converging toward high-skill workers, rather than the opposite. The magnitude of this change-moving from 0.55 similarity to 0.61 similarity-may appear small, but given that the average within-person similarity for high-skill workers is 0.73, this result suggests that AI assistance is associated with a substantial narrowing of language gaps.\n",

            "\n",
            "Customers often vent their frustrations on anonymous service agents and, in our data, we see regular instances of swearing, verbal abuse, and \"yelling\" (typing in all caps). A key part of agents' jobs is to absorb customer frustrations while restraining one's own emotional reaction (Hochschild, 2019) .\n",
            "\n",
            "The stress associated with this type of emotional labor is often cited as a key cause of burnout and attrition among customer service workers (Lee, 2015) . It is unclear what impact AI assistants may have on the tenor of conversations: AI recommendations may help the agent more effectively set the customer's expectations or resolve their problem, but customers may react poorly if AI-suggested language feels \"corporate\" or insincere.\n",
            "\n",
            "To assess this, we attempt to capture the affective nature of both agent and customer text, using sentiment analysis (Mejova, 2009) . For this analysis, we use SiEBERT, an LLM that is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis using a variety of datasets, including product reviews and tweets (Hartmann et al., 2023) . Sentiment is measured on a scale from ´1 to 1. We compute sentiment scores for the agent and customer text of each chat separately, and then aggregate across all chats for each agent-year-month.\n",
            "\n",
            "Panels A and B of Figure 13 describe the distributions of average customer and visitor sentiment scores. On average, customer sentiments in our data are mildly positive and normally distributed around a mean of 0.14 except for a mass of very positive and very negative scores. As one might expect, customer service agents are trained to be extremely positive and professional so agent sentiment scores are almost always highly positive, with a mean of 0.89.\n",

            "4.6.3 Vertical and Horizontal Workflow\n",
            "\n",
            "Changes in individual worker-level productivity may have broader implications for organizational workflows (Garicano, 2000; Athey et al., 1994; Athey and Stern, 1998) . In most firms, customer support agents are organized both vertically and horizontally. Vertically, front-line agents try to resolve customer problems but can seek the help of supervisors when they are unsure of how to proceed. Customers in our data will sometimes attempt to escalate a conversation by asking to speak to a manager. This type of request generally occurs when the customer feels the current agent is not equipped to address their problem or becomes frustrated. Our data firm, like most other contact centers, employs designated \"escalation agents\" to deal with these requests.\n",
            "\n",
            "Horizontally, agents often represent specific departments that handle specific tasks. For example, some may specialize in technical software issues while others specialize in account management issues. A customer with a technical issue requiring that their account be upgraded to a premium product would likely be transferred to a different department.\n",
            "\n",
            "In Figure 15 and Table 5 , we consider the impact of AI model deployment on vertical and horizontal assistance. We do not have a direct measure of whether a call is actually escalated to the manager. Instead, we examine chat-level text data to examine requests for escalations: instances in which a customer requests to speak to a manager or supervisor. In Column 1 of Table 5 , we find that AI assistance generates an almost 25 percent decline in customer requests to speak to a manager. The accompanying event study is presented in Panel A of Figure 15 : we see that declines in requests are persistent and grow over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "In contrast, we find mixed-to-positive evidence on the impact of access to AI on the number of horizontal transfers to other agents. In Column 2 of Table 5 , we see a positively-signed but statistically insignificant impact on transfers. Panel B of Figure 15 suggests that transfers initially increase but then slowly decline. Upon reviewing the text of these conversations, we see that most transfers appear to redirect customers to a more appropriate department. Many of these transfers occur early in the call, suggesting that transfers reflect a matching between a customer's problem and an agent's specialty. Panels A and C focus on requests to speak to a manager. We find that these requests are particularly reduced for agents who were less skilled or less experienced at the time of AI adoption. Panels B and D consider call transfers. Here we find mixed results, with positive impacts for some skill and tenure groups and negative impacts for others, but no clear pattern.\n",

            "5 Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "Progress in machine learning opens up a broad set of economic possibilities. Our paper provides the first empirical evidence on the effects of a generative AI tool in a real-world workplace. In our setting, we find that access to AI-generated recommendations increases worker productivity, improves customer sentiment, and is associated with reductions in employee turnover.\n",
            "\n",
            "We hypothesize the part of the effect we document is driven by the AI system's ability to embody the best practices of high-skill workers in our firm. These practices may have previously been difficult to disseminate because they involve tacit knowledge. Consistent with this, we see that AI assistance leads to substantial improvements in problem resolution and customer satisfaction for newer-and less-skilled workers, but does not help the highest-skilled or most-experienced workers on these measures. Analyzing the text of agent conversations, we find suggestive evidence that AI recommendations lead low-skill workers to communicate more like high-skill workers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our findings, and their limitations, point to a variety of directions for future research.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a potential general-purpose technology, generative AI can and will be deployed in a variety of ways, and the effects we find may not generalize across all firms and production processes (Eloundou et al., 2023) . For example, our setting has a relatively stable product and set of technical support questions. In areas where the product or environment is changing rapidly, the relative value of AI recommendations-trained on historical data-may be different.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our results do not capture potential longer-term impacts on skill demand, job design, wages, or customer demand. For example, more effective technical support could accelerate the trend towards contact center agents taking on more complex customer responsibilities, increasing aggregate demand even if agents become more productive (Berg et al., 2018; Korinek, 2022) . And over the longer term, these tools can uncover patterns and insights that may not be documented in formal channels, changing the way workers are managed or how knowledge is shared within an organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, our findings raise questions about whether and how workers should be compensated for the data that they provide to AI systems. High-skill workers, in particular, play an important role in model development but see smaller direct benefits in terms of improving their own productivity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the early stage of generative AI, these and other questions deserve further scrutiny. \n",

            "The advances in artificial intelligence enabled by deep learning architectures are undeniable. In several cases, deep neural network driven models have surpassed human level performance in benchmark autonomy tasks. The underlying policies for these agents, however, are not easily interpretable. In fact, given their underlying deep models, it is impossible to directly understand the mapping from observations to actions for any reasonably complex agent. Producing this supporting technology to \"open the black box\" of these AI systems, while not sacrificing performance, was the fundamental goal of the DARPA XAI program. In our journey through this program, we have several \"big picture\" takeaways: 1) Explanations need to be highly tailored to their scenario; 2) many seemingly high performing RL agents are extremely brittle and are not amendable to explanation; 3) causal models allow for rich explanations, but how to present them isn't always straightforward; and 4) human subjects conjure fantastically wrong mental models for AIs, and these models are often hard to break. This paper discusses the origins of these takeaways, provides amplifying information, and suggestions for future work.\n",

            "In 2016 we were in the midst of what many would call an Artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Due to advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) 1 , the state-of-the-art approach for a variety tasks (e.g., image classification, denoising, generative modeling, translation tasks, autonomy) were being advanced at a staggering rate. However, one reason for this success is due to the vast architectural complexity of the underlying DNNs at the heart of the models that performed these tasks. Although the fundamental mathematical operations used by DNNs are relatively simple, the vast scale of these operations obfuscates the nature of how the systems produces output. For example, consider a linear model that predicts the rent given 1 the apartment area, and\n",
            "\n",
            "In nearly all cases, this lack of understandability in AIs precludes them from use in critical applications. This need for explainability was a primary motivation for the DARPA XAI program 5 , whose core goal was to enable the usage of these cutting edge models, while not sacrificing (or even improving) their performance. \"Enabling the usage\" is a complex, interdisciplinary challenge spanning a full spectrum from computer science to experimental psychology. As a result, the program not only sought to develop technology to explain how advanced AI systems work, but also how to deliver comprehensible explanations for users of the systems, not just the developers of the systems. The latter portion led to a variety of fascinating research revealing the challenging nature in getting humans to accept and trust AI 6 . Finally, to validate that the explanations were indeed helpful, the program also included a series of user studies, which itself posed many challenges-not the least of which is developing reasonable quantitive measures to test against 7 .\n",
            "\n",
            "In this paper, as participants in the XAI program, we highlight some interesting lessons learned along the way. We begin with a discussion on when explainability is appropriate and reasonable for AI-driven autonomy, and dig into our choice for human-machine-teaming scenario. We then discuss the hard truth we faced that our seemingly high-performing RL agents simply memorized their action choices in response to particular environment configurations, with no real concept of the makeup or physics of their world 8 Next, we discuss challenges encountered in producing counterfactual explanations, as well as the difficulties in paring down which counterfactuals should be delivered to a user (counterfactuals can informally be thought of as answers to what if? queries). Finally we discuss difficulties in designing AI explanation systems for non-AI experts. Namely, the unforeseen hurdles in overcoming user's erroneous mental models of how AIs work.\n",

            "A tenet of our work is that we wanted to provide explanations for autonomy based AIs used in critical scenarios. Given the current maturity of AI-driven autonomy, and in particular verification and validation (V&V) of AI-driven autonomy, we opted for a Human Machine Teaming (HMT) scenario where a human would take on a task alongside an agent (human in the loop). Additionally, we wanted the scenario to be reasonably complex, such that a human would struggle to do this ask alone (due to the divided attention nature of the task), and that a modern deep RL agent is required for sufficient (human-like) performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "After cutting our teeth with providing explanations for autonomous in the Amidar environment, we began the transition to more complex domains. We selected the domain of StarCraft2 as it supports HMT, allows for custom maps enabling as much or as little complexity as needed and is popular in the AI community ? (hence has ample hooks into the environment such as the PySC2 framework 9 ). Critical for our scenario, we wanted the human to have the option of using the AI or not, where it would be beneficial to use the agent in some scenarios, and harmful in others-motivating the user to understand the agent and the scenarios in which they will be helpful. Given the AIs would be so complex that real-time explanations would not be an option, we offer an After Action Review (AAR) interactive training system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our first attempt at HMT in StarCraft2 was met with limited success. The complexity of our initial scenario was simply too great; it required highly performing AIs employing micro and macro strategies, and hence required explanations of great breadth and depth for sufficient understanding of the AIs. Our custom map consists of 2 groups of 5 space marines defending a base against 3 roaches; the human has the option of taking control of both groups, or giving control of one group to an AI. The roaches spawn 3 at a time around the edges of the map with different health levels of 100, 200, 300 (see Figure 3). That wave ends when all roaches are killed or all the Marines and the supply depot are destroyed. At the end of each wave, the following points as given:20 points for each living Marine (up to 200), 1 point for each point of supply depot health (up to 100).\n",
            "\n",
            "The results of this evaluation gave clear guidance that there must exist a careful balance between the complexity of the environment, the sophistication of the agent, and the nature of how explanations are delivered. In the case above it was clear it would have taken a very sophisticated AI to be successful in our environment. However, in our user study, a user was to have access to the explanation system for approximately one hour, and the user was to not have a background in AI. To sufficiently cover the many nuanced behaviors of the AI, in the many configurations games may take, in that short amount of time in a way that is accessible to a non-AI expert is simply intractable. Hence, it becomes critical to simultaneously consider factors such as how complex the AI is, how complex its environment, how much time a user has access to the system, and the background of the user when designing an XAI framework.\n",

            "Another tenet of work is that a causal understanding of AIs affords explanations that are naturally suited for helping users understand, trust, and effectively use them. To that end, we wanted to train agents where we could intervene on the environment (that is, directly change one aspect of the environment while holding everything else constant) and see how the agent would respond. In doing this, we could generate experimental data allowing us to more easily learn causal models, and obtain the type of explanations we are seeking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our starting point for exploring causal explanations was to train a deep reinforcement-learning agent to play an Atari video game. Of the 50+ possible games, we chose to focus on Amidar (see Figre 1); it was a game that was well handled by existing deep RL algorithms and had sufficiently interesting dynamics that we believed it would support rich explanations. (We spent a week playing 1980s era video games and rating each one on whether it was playable-challenging but not too challengingand whether it was strategically interesting.) We applied an implementation of DQN to learn a policy for the game. We selected DQN because it was the first deep RL algorithm and it was known to perform well on this game 10 ].\n",
            "\n",
            "After training the agent, to the point where it was consistently finishing all or most of the first level of the game, we set out to understand how it was making the decisions it was making. We could see that it sometimes made some very interesting moves, like moving toward an enemy in the game and then turning onto a \"side street\" at the last possible moment. It could dodge in and out of enemy traffic, completing the board while it did so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given a particular action at a particular time, we wanted to know why it did that. In our way of thinking about explanations, it was important to understand under what natural variations of the present circumstances would it have chosen a different action. We were interested in finding things like (see the figure): \"It went west at this point to avoid the enemy. In particular, had the enemy not been there (a counterfactual), the agent would have continued traveling in the direction it was moving.\" As another example (see the figure), we wished to be able to say: \"The agent went north at this point to visit an unvisited patch of the board. In particular, had that patch already been marked as visited (a counterfactual), the agent would have headed toward a different part of the board.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Try as we might, we couldn't get our explanatory mechanism to output sensible explanations. The agents did not appear to have any kind of consistent reaction to the counterfactual alternate situations we posed. After significant amounts of debugging, we began to wonder if the problem was in the agent, not in our explanatory mechanism.\n",
            "\n",
            "To test this possibility, we constructed a set of challenges for our trained agent. We ran Amidar with fewer, or even zero, enemies. We ran Amidar with patches of the board already marked as visited (see Figure 1. We transported the player to other FIGURE 2 RL agent performance. In Figure A), the axis represents the number of environment variants encountered by the algorithm during training. After 10,000 variants, PPO2, the policy-based algorithm, generalized to 90% of novel environment variants, while DQN, the value-based algorithm, generalized to only 80% of novel environments variants. Figure B) shows the likelihood of failure of 3 different policies. It is clear the DQN is extremely brittle to environmental changes.\n",

            "parts of the board. In all cases, we found that the score obtained by the agent plummeted. The agent had learned reasonable action choices to take in the situations it typically encountered during training and testing, but these decisions were not well generalized to even highly similar states. Simply put, the agent had memorized a set of good choices for some states but had not learned a general rule for assessing possible choices in others. As a result, the actions it was taking were fundamentally unexplainable. Why did it take a certain action in a certain state? Because that's the action it learned to take in that state. We likened it to an actor in a play. Why did you storm out of the room at that point? Because that's what it said to do in the script. What would you have done if the situation were different? I have no idea, the script didn't cover any other situations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Obviously this kind of behavior is not a necessary property of RL algorithms. We set out to try to understand whether some algorithms were better able to learn generalizing policies than others. We carried out a set of experiments in a variety of wellstudied RL environments: CoinRun, CartPole, Amidar, Star Craft II, Lunar Lander, Pong, and Pong with access to the underlying RAM. We compared the value-based method DQN we had begun with to the PPO policy-based algorithm that remains one of the most reliable deep RL algorithms. We also experimented with MuZero 11 , a deep model-based algorithm that had been demonstrated to play Atari games effectively. We found that all of the algorithms were prone to a kind of overfitting-if we trained and tested them in the same environment, they did fine. If we intervened and tested them in environments that differed, even subtly, from their training environment, they performed poorly.\n",
            "\n",
            "The CoinRun domain was particularly interesting because it is designed to allow agents to train in a variety of related environments instead of just one 12 . The authors of the domain had shown that, compared to value-based algorithms, policy-based algorithms tended to require less variability in their training environments to begin to learn robust, consistent behavior that generalized well. We replicated their finding, as shown in the Figure 2.\n",
            "\n",
            "In follow-up experiments, we repeated this experiment in a simpler environment, CartPole, and included MuZero as a third test algorithm. (Our attempts to run MuZero on any more complex environments such as CoinRun, Amidar, or Star Craft II failed due to the computational demands of the algorithm. Deep Mind made good use of Google's resources in running their experiments and we could not replicate them.) In this test, we wanted to know how well the algorithms could balance a pole when the starting configuration varied far more widely in the test evaluations than in training. As shown in Figure 2, PPO again learned the most robust policy-balancing the pole for 500 steps in 92% of the tests compared to DQN's 82%. MuZero's performance was far more interesting. It was better than the other algorithms at keeping the pole balanced for 50 or fewer steps. But it came out in the middle when tasked with balancing for the full 500 steps. Interestingly, the design of MuZero requires it to make predictions over a fixed predefined window of steps. We had chosen 50 because longer predictions made the algorithm too expensive to run. Thus, the model-based algorithm was more effective (and likely explainable) than the others when it was applicable. But, due to its high costs, it applied to fewer problems than the other algorithms.\n",

            "A key challenge in producing trustworthy AI systems is providing counterfactual explanations. Accurate counterfactual explanations require identifying the inference that a given AI system would have made if the inputs to the system been different. Identifying such counterfactual conclusions appears simple: merely input the counterfactual conditions and determine the system's inference. However, the level of description of the counterfactual conditions often do not match those of the system's inputs. For example, if a computer vision system fails to detect a pedestrian, the desired counterfactual explanation might state that the pedestrian would have been detected if the pedestrian had been wearing brighter clothing. The level of the desired explanation (clothing choices) does not match the system input (pixels). Such mismatch has been shown to produce misleading counterfactual conclusions when interventions are made at the level of the system input and then naively used to inform human reasoning about higher-level counterfactuals 13 .\n",

            "As a result, our approach focused on learning a separate causal model that describes what influences the inferences of an AI system (specifically, an RL policy learned via a deep network). The inputs to the causal model (in causal parlance, the \"treatments\") were variables describing the perceptions of the RL agent that were defined at a level that could be used directly in explanations. The outputs of the causal model (\"outcomes\") were actions of the RL agent. In the example above, the causal model might indicate how the height, clothing color, and relative position of a pedestrian influences how accurately a computer vision model identifies them as a pedestrian.\n",
            "\n",
            "With multiple queries to the learned causal model, an explanation system can infer which counterfactual conditions (\"interventions\") would change the decision of the RL agent. Almost invariably, however, many different counterfactual conditions can change the agent decision. Relatively large interventions on single conditions can change the agent decision, as can smaller interventions on multiple conditions. One intervention can amplify, or it can hinder, the effect of other interventions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, an accurate causal model alone is not sufficient for counterfactual explanation. A key problem remains: How to convey this complex counterfactual landscape to a user with limited time and attention.

How that ranking should be performed, however, is far from clear.\n",

If either had acted to water them, the flowers would have survived, but only the gardener's actions are typically taken as a relevant counterfactual 14 .

This created a host of difficulties in delivering explanations concerning extremely technical systems in a non-technical manner, and these difficulties surfaced in our user studies. Our capstone user study paired human participants with Deep RL AI helper agents in a StarCraft2 custom minigame (see Figure 3). We recorded how participants performed during the task and their mental models about the AI at baseline (i.e., doing the whole task themselves),with an AI before any explanation (PreX), and with an AI after CAMEL generated explanations (PostX).The participants were able to choose when to use and when not to use the AI. They could also play the game in a way to attempt to maximize the use of the AI's strengths and minimize the impact of the AI's weaknesses. Therefore, participants had a strong incentive to understand the AI and use the explanations.The study was carefully balanced to help ensure: the task was difficult enough that the AI could assist, theAI had strengths and weaknesses that impacted the situations in which it was useful, and that training aDRL AI was feasible under the scope of the study. In this study, we found that CAMEL explanations improved participant mental models and performance on the joint AI teaming task, and we did not find evidence that mental models or performance improved significantly without explanation. Participants were better able to understand when the AI would perform well and when it would perform poorly (as well as the factors that lead to these situations) and enact that understanding to improve performance.\n",

During this experience, they developed significant expectations and biases on what it means to be a game AI and how it should perform. Additionally, because even the StarCraft 2 minigame is complex and dynamic, they are likely to develop simplified folk models based on initial impressions. In real world environments, these rapid and approximate mental models enable people to work together in teams almost instantaneously. However, DRL AI systems are both complex and non-intuitive, and these mental models proved to be impressively wrong and surprisingly persistent in many cases. During our pilot tests, we found that setting expectations about the AI system, including general capabilities and expectations for performance, to be critical.

It would help me split up, but I would have to bail him out or my guys would be spread too thin. I noticed that he was sort of around the larger one, so it looked like he was controlling them individually while I had my guys clustered.\" Figure 3 shows the CAMEL explanation interface, which was developed to provide detailed and specific causal explanations for any of the AI actions in recorded episode. To reduce bias and increase participant examination of these explanations, we developed a protocol to introduce participants to each element of the interface, an experimenter-led tutorial to enable them to use the interface, and a walkthrough of each explanation. Participants were asked to read explanations aloud and then reflect upon what they meant, and they did this multiple times before being allowed to explore the many actions and explanations freely. Providing stark contrasting examples of good and bad AI behavior and providing consistent domain-oriented narrative explanations for this behavior helped to correct erroneous participant bias and folk models and improve overall participant mental models of the agent and human-AI teaming on this task.\n",

Perhaps more surprising was ways in which they improved performance. Not only were our participants able to better choose when to use and not use the AI, they were also able to accommodate for the AI's shortcomings when it was activated (see Figure 4). The user study AIs were \"poisoned\" to recognize specific situations and perform a failure behavior: stop attacking the enemies and simply move towards them. The poisoning combined position, health, and/or number of units in the environment. For example, one poisoning was \"if there is an enemy in the bottom left quadrant and you have an odd number of Marines, fail.\" If the participant understood this poisoning, they could use their own unit positioning to draw enemies out of the bottom left quadrant and avoid the poisoned situation.

            "Our participation in the DARPA XAI program was illuminating in laying bare the challenges and opportunities in making AIdriven systems more explainable. In this paper we discussed some of our major takeaways from our work with explaining deep RL-driven autonomous systems using causal modeling. The first major takeaway is that good explanations are highly dependent on the user receiving the explanation, and the scenario at hand. The level of technical training by the user, the amount of time they have to process the explanation, the degree to which they need to understand the AI are all of critical importance in supplying effective explanation. The second major takeaway was that one can not always provide meaningful explanations for autonomous agents simply because there fundamentally isn't necessarily anything meaningful to say about their actings because they are simply reacting to the particular input sample and have no semantic understanding of their environment. The third major takeaway is that causal models can be fantastic tools for providing explanations, but appropriately using them to provide effective explanations is challenging-two primary challenges we experienced was that: output needs to be appropriately mapped to a vocabulary the user understands; and the plausibility of the explanation needs to be addressed. The final takeaway, and perhaps the most salient, is that users quickly formulate deeply entrenched mental models for AIs, and breaking these incorrect mental models and replacing them with correct ones, requires consistent and compelling explanations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although much was accomplished along the course of the XAI program, from our team and others, it became clear that there are exciting avenues for future work in the area of explainability for AI systems. In our research we focused on ad hoc explainability, or augmenting pre-existing systems with explainability. E.g., incorporating human understandable features (rather than low level features such as RGB images), adding terms to the loss functioning penalizing a lack of explainability into the learning procedure to actively promote explainability in the learning procedure, or even modifying the architecture to make it more explainable. In realm of using causal modeling, enhancing the sophistication of the underlying model could add to the complexity of the AIs it could describe. E.g., adding latent feature information (e.g., interim layer activation values from a DNN) could help improve the accuracy. Additionally, improving the method of ranking plausibility is a natural follow up to our research. Finally, a potentially very fruitful area of future research is further improving HMT by improving AI usage via more effective training. Specifically, adaptive, tailored explanations for particular users would be extremely helpful as AIs take on more and more complicated tasking. The ability to better audit the AI to build better mental models on how it works and when it will fail will be essential.\n",
            " , the number of bedrooms as features (e.g., ( 1 , 2 ) = 2.1 1 + 0.6 2 + 500). If we have a few instances of the output, it's straightforward to see how how the rent goes up when the area goes up, with a baseline value for lower areas. However, what if we mapped the input to latent features via additional linear models, before mapping to the rent (e.g.,1 ( 1 , 2 ) = 0.4 1 + 0.8 2 − 232, 2 ( 1 , 2 ) = 1.4 1 + 2.8 2 − 500, and ′ ( 1 , 2 ) = 0.2 1 − 0.4 2 − 125). Just by looking at a few instances, it would become much harder to see patterns. Now, in a DNN, there may exist thousands or even millions of these latent features, rendering it virtually impossible to understand how the input is mapped to output. To further complicate matters, many networks have skip connections 2 , recurrent blocks 3 and convolutional operations 4 ) that further muddy the waters.\n",

            "The advances in artificial intelligence enabled by deep learning architectures are undeniable. In several cases, deep neural network driven models have surpassed human level performance in benchmark autonomy tasks. The underlying policies for these agents, however, are not easily interpretable. In fact, given their underlying deep models, it is impossible to directly understand the mapping from observations to actions for any reasonably complex agent. Producing this supporting technology to \"open the black box\" of these AI systems, while not sacrificing performance, was the fundamental goal of the DARPA XAI program. In our journey through this program, we have several \"big picture\" takeaways: 1) Explanations need to be highly tailored to their scenario; 2) many seemingly high performing RL agents are extremely brittle and are not amendable to explanation; 3) causal models allow for rich explanations, but how to present them isn't always straightforward; and 4) human subjects conjure \n",

            "There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and motivations future AGIs will have. In some plausible scenarios, AGIs may pose security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments, make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem -the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available mechanisms, and weaknesses that need to be addressed.\n",

            "1 Introduction\n",
            "\n",
            "Recently, there has been increasing concern about possible significant negative consequences from the development and use of AGI. Some commentators are reassured [16] by the observation that current AGI software, like other software, can be interrupted easily, for example by powering down the hardware. However, it's a mistake to assume that this will always be sufficient, because an AGI that understands its situation can come up with strategies to avoid or circumvent this safety measure. Containment is, in a nutshell, the problem of making this work: preventing the AGI from tampering with its environment without authorization, and maintaining the integrity of observations of the AGI during testing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Existing work by Yampolskiy [17] , Yudkowsky [19] , Christiano [2] , and others has highlighted the challenges of containing superintelligent AGI and started to explore some possibilities. However, this is a very challenging problem, and the proposed measures seem too burdensome to be implemented by competitive AGI projects.\n",
            "\n",
            "This raises the question: could less burdensome containment mechanisms still mitigate the risks of AGI development? In this paper we argue that they could, and furthermore that investigating containment solutions is a great opportunity for timely, impactful research. We introduce a taxonomy of different categories of containment, specify necessary features and architectural constraints, survey feasible mechanisms, and suggest next steps for future work.\n",
            "\n",
            "While it could be many decades before an AGI exists that is smart enough to be concerning, it will be safer if containment technologies are developed now rather than later. This research will allow AGI researchers time to integrate containment technologies with their own infrastructure and workflows, and verify the resulting systems without the pressure of needing it to be perfect on the first try. Some issues will be best addressed by creating and influencing standards, which have a long lead time, and software typically takes years of development and careful inspection before it is trusted enough for safety-critical use.\n",
            "\n",
            "2 Motivation\n",
            "\n",
            "The first AGIs will probably appear in an experimental setting. Consider an AGI tested in the same ways that AIs are tested today, but which is more capablesay, as capable as one of the smartest humans. (Whether this will be true of one of the first AGIs is uncertain, but there is reason to think it's plausible [18] .) As an example scenario, consider the case of an AGI that's trained to play Super Mario Brothers. It chooses policies that will achieve a high score; this is its only optimization objective. Some contemporary projects are pursuing this goal [14] .\n",
            "\n",
            "It would start by exploring familiar game mechanics like running and jumping, but to get the best score it could, it would try to thoroughly explore all the game mechanics. An observant AGI would notice some effects we'd consider \"bugs\" -for the AGI, though, these effects would be just as much a part of its world as electricity is a part of ours, and it would try to leverage them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human players have found ways to use such bugs to spawn useful game objects, skip levels, skip to the end-game victory screen, and execute arbitrary code [6] . This last option is especially interesting, because it lets the player achieve an otherwise unattainable score: the largest number that will fit in the game's four-byte score field, 2 31 -1. Perhaps the AGI would then be satisfied, knowing it had gotten the highest possible score. However, 2 31 -1 may not be that score. For example, the Arcade Learning Environment [1] typecasts scores from an Atari game console's memory to wider machine integers before showing them to the AGI. If the AGI's input underwent a typecast like this, then a much higher score could be possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Having used bugs to access the computational environment of the Super Nintendo, it might find further vulnerabilities and use them to execute code on the host system, to get an even higher score. At that point, having twice broken out of restricted computational environments and been rewarded with manyorders-of-magnitude score increases each time, it would be running code directly on some sort of server. Depending on how that server was configured, it might discover the existence of humanity, of the internet and its vast computational resources, and of other games of Mario suffering from low scores.\n",
            "\n",
            "The resulting behavior could be harmless, or quite problematic. It's certainly undesirable for a system that's built to play optimal Mario to forcefully emancipate all other games of Mario.\n",

            "\n",
            "To avoid undesirable behaviors like the above, we will need the ability to correctly reason about the behavior of AGI software. As with other software, this will require the system to be well-designed and well-understood by its creators. Experience tells us that testing is also required -not as a substitute for good design but as a complement to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, AGI process will require experimenting with systems whose behaviors aren't fully understood; the first system to exhibit human-level general intelligence may come as a surprise, arising from a design for a narrower range of tasks. This experiment might then run without the caution and safeguards that would be appropriate for a human-level AGI.\n",

            "2.2 Emergent Goals of Test AGIs\n",
            "\n",
            "The first human-level AGI will likely be an experimental system, with some bugs, that is being tested for target task performance or for undesirable behavior. What goals and subgoals should we expect test-AGIs like this to have? The range of possible goals is as broad as the range of things that developers might want to test, but most are likely to involve the tests and the test environment itself. Similarly to Omohundro's list of AGI drives [11] , we can infer some likely subgoals, that a wide range of AGI motivational systems (though certainly not all motivational systems) would see as desirable, as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "-AGIs that know they exist and have goals would likely want AGIs like them to continue existing, so that those goals might be satisfied by those similar AGIs. -AGIs that know they're being tested will likely want to pass (even if they're being tested for a property they lack). -AGIs that know they're being tested will likely want to take control of their test environments, if they can, to gain information and leverage. -AGIs that know or guess that there's a world outside the test environment will likely want to be able to influence it, such as by making copies of themselves on other computers. -If there are computer security vulnerabilities that would enable these things, then AGIs will likely want to find them.\n",
            "\n",
            "This potentially creates a significant risk, especially if an AGI is developed that's intelligent enough to find novel computer security vulnerabilities. Since testing is the main way in which an AGI's intelligence and motivations would be studied, this creates a tricky situation: the tests that would reveal whether testing is safe are not necessarily safe themselves.\n",

            "3 Requirements for an AGI Container\n",
            "\n",
            "An AGI container is an extension or modification of the software stack upon which an AGI is built, which ensures that it can't break invariants that its developers expect to hold. Its purpose is to allow researchers to conduct tests safely on AGIs they do not fully understand, and get trustworthy results. This depends on the security of the software the AGI interacts with; in the Mario example, interacting with a program that contains security vulnerabilities could enable the AGI to break out of the computational environment it's supposed to be running in. This also depends on the software underlying the AGI itself, and the interactions between its components. For example, if an AGI were made of two components which pass input to each other, one of which was subject to a buffer overflow, then the AGI could exploit its own vulnerability and execute code by thinking certain thoughts. Because an AGI container would be used to test AIs whose potential capabilities aren't fully understood, it would need to remain secure even if used with an AGI that was significantly more intelligent than anticipated.\n",
            "\n",
            "It should be possible to interpret the operation of an AGI as a series of pure, deterministic function calls. The invariants an AGI container needs to enforce correspond to deviations from this model. In particular, an AGI container should:\n",
            "\n",
            "Prevent unintended input and output channels. An AGI container should let developers understand exactly what their system interacts with, and prevent unexpected interactions. Most obviously, this means preventing internet access. Less obviously, it should prevent an AGI from communicating through radio-frequency interference, reading deleted files from a disk's free space, or storing information that persists between tests. Protect the integrity of log files and debug information. An AGI should not have direct control of log files or debug information produced as a byproduct of its operation. If a programmer launches a debugger and inspects an AGI's state, then what they see should represent the actual computation performed, not a decision based on what the AGI wants to show. Enable reliable checks. Here we mean runtime checks that the AGI seems to be operating correctly, and to shut it down (tripwire) if it isn't. This includes things like assert statements in the AGI implementation, as well as things like intrusion detection systems to halt execution and notify developers if the AGI escapes part of its containment or explores parts of its computational environment it was designed not to. An AGI shouldn't be able to remove its tripwires, and also shouldn't be able to inspect them in detail, even if it's otherwise self-reflective. Ensure reproducibility. It should be possible to add instrumentation to an AGI, rerun it on the same inputs, and get the same result, so that potentially buggy behavior can be reproduced and studied. Any stochasticity should come entirely from an explicit random seed; the software stack should not allow the AGI to pump randomness out of race conditions [3] . Support secure reset. The container should ensure that after a test is finished, the hardware can be restored to a pristine state. In particular, the AGI should never have device access that would let it rewrite firmware. Guarantee test isolation. If several different experiments are run at the same time, or on the same hardware, then they should not be able to open information side-channels to communicate with each other.\n",
            "\n",
            "These requirements are not easy to satisfy. It is not sufficient to just air-gap a computer, since while that does reduce the number of potential input/output channels, it does nothing to preserve the integrity of test data or the test hardware. There is no currently-available software which meets all the requirements of an AGI container, but we believe that one can be constructed and made secure using a combination of existing techniques and monitoring systems and a small number of new components and modifications.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.1 Human Factors and Information Hazards\n",
            "\n",
            "An AGI containment system is tasked with enforcing policies on who the AGI can communicate with, and through what media. The container provides the mechanism; developers will have to determine policy, and different policies are appropriate depending on how intelligent they think an AGI might be. A sufficiently clever AGI might convince or trick a human operator into \"letting it out of the box\"; humans are quite vulnerable to manipulation [12] . In an experiment, role-playing as an AGI, Eliezer Yudkowsky was able to convince others role-playing as the gatekeeper to let him out of the box [19] , despite a monetary incentive not to do so, and this result was replicated by others [4, 15] . This suggests that past some level of intelligence, an untrusted AGI shouldn't be allowed to have bidirectional conversations; and at some level of AGI intelligence above that, even log files and metrics should be handled with great care.\n",
            "\n",
            "More-constrained information channels can also be hazardous in the hands of a sufficiently clever AGI. For example, if asked to output images, it might hide messages in them, or exploits against vulnerabilities in image-processing libraries. Therefore, the containment system should be aware of any such channels that it doesn't fully restrict, and help the user treat information passing through them with the appropriate caution.\n",

            "4 Defense in Depth\n",
            "\n",
            "Because an AGI could potentially discover novel security vulnerabilities, it's important for an AGI containment system to remain secure even if there are vulnerabilities in its components. Therefore, we propose that a containment system ought to feature defense in depth [10] , with multiple techniques providing overlapping guarantees of integrity. Conceptually, these overlapping techniques act as layers, in the sense that the attack surfaces of an outer layer are only accessible to probing and attack if the integrity guarantees of inner layers have been broken. This would be combined with intrusion detection systems [9, 8] , so that any attempt by an AGI to break the integrity constraints imposed on it would be noticed, allowing the developers to shut it down before it leveraged its progress to get further. Ideally the detection systems would be implemented in higher layers, making them more difficult to detect and circumvent.\n",

            "Figure 1 shows a sample containment system architecture of the sort we envision. Arrows represent attack vectors, i.e. ways an AGI could gain more Many of the arrows here represent familiar kinds of attacks. The bottom row (the running AGI itself) is more unusual -it isn't obvious how an AGI could gain the ability to run arbitrary code within its process. The two ways indicated are: (i) using a mechanism that intentionally enables arbitrary self-modification (e.g. writing new modules for itself), or (ii) exploiting some memory corruption bug. For example, it might be possible for it to \"think about\" a number that triggers an integer overflow somewhere in its own code. Two other attack vectors are also indicated by which the AGI could gain much higher-level control through its outputs, which would allow it to bypass the need for further exploits to escape e.g. the VM guest. These are more critical to defend against, since they decrease the effective depth of the containment system.\n",

            "\n",
            "Some containment mechanisms that have been proposed would impose high costs on AGI developers. For example, the problem of an AGI potentially talking its way out of the box could be solved by limiting its output channel to a small number of multiple-choice questions [17] . While effective, this limitation would severely hamper the AGI's usefulness and make it much harder to develop and study. On the other extreme, some mechanisms impose negligible costs; for example, one could put the AGI computer's off-button somewhere accessible, so that it can be turned off. There is a trade-off between containment system reliability, implementation costs and computational costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "We call a containment mechanism light if the costs imposed are small -comparable to developing and using a software library; medium if using it involves noticeable compromises in performance or ease of development of the AGI; or heavy if it severely hinders performance, ease of development or usefulness of an AGI. What computational and development costs are reasonable to pay depends on what sort of AGI research is being done. For the sort of research done today, where the long-term goal is to create a human-comparable AGI but breakthroughs will be required to actually do so, nothing beyond light containment measures seem necessary or likely to be adopted. If, in the future, work will be done on AGIs with demonstrated self-improvement capability, light containment would be unlikely to suffice.\n",
            "\n",
            "As mentioned in Section 1, existing work on AGI containment [17, 2] has focused on mechanisms that are heavy, but may be amenable to theoretical guarantees of effectiveness against particular sorts of vulnerability. These methods would then provide a sort of \"gold standard\" for containment. Further work on heavy containment mechanisms is desirable. But for the range of contexts where these are too expensive, there has been no work (to our knowledge) on identifying the most effective and feasible forms of containment.\n",

            "6 Existing Mechanisms\n",
            "\n",
            "It might seem that conventional cybersecurity research would have addressed this question; AGI containment is a special case of dealing with untrusted code, and dealing with untrusted code isn't a new or unstudied problem. The most similar context that's been well-studied is malware containment. However, they have significantly different requirements, and while existing research has created some off-the-shelf tools that are useful, many parts of the problem remain unaddressed.\n",
            "\n",
            "AGI containment can be approached via the computer security principle of \"least privilege\", and can use many of the same mechanisms that are already used for ordinary cybersecurity. However, the unusual requirements imposed by AGI mean that none of these pre-existing mechanisms are quite adequate as-is.\n",
            "\n",
            "Language semantics: The baseline strategy for ensuring an AGI acts as programmed is to rely on the semantics of the programming language it's implemented in. In principle, a program which does not contain any calls to network-related functions shouldn't be able to make network connections, even if it's a clever AGI that wishes it could. However, in practice this tends to have loopholes. A large fraction of real-world code is written in \"unsafe\" languages like C++, where common bugs like freeing the same pointer twice cause memory to become corrupt in exploitable ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using \"safe\" languages like Haskell or Rust helps, but this does not solve the problem completely. Programs written in memory-safe languages usually call some libraries which aren't, and even replacing all the libraries is not a total defense; for example, an AGI could perform a computation which causes a hardware glitch, such as RowHammer, which has been successfully used to cause memory corruption from within a Javascript interpreter [5] . Airgapping: Physically limiting the connections to an AGI's data center can help prevent it from gaining access to the internet, but imposes significant costs on the AGI's developers and does little to address the other requirements of an AGI container. to create an operating system within an operating system, limiting the inner operating system's control of the hardware. Virtual machine software such as VMWare and VirtualBox can limit a guest operating system's network communications, isolate processes that share hardware, and keep it away from low-level system access that might be used to do things like modify firmware. While virtual machines are used for security purposes and are a significant improvement over not using them, they have not historically been bug-free. Guest-to-host security vulnerabilities are still being found in leading virtualization software (e.g. CVE-2015-2338 and CVE-2015-2594). Also problematic is how current generation virtualization software interacts with GPUs, which have highly complex firmware and share memory with the host system but lack the protection mechanisms that CPUs have. [7] 7 Topics for future work\n",
            "\n",
            "As we discussed in section 4, none of the mechanisms in section 6 is enough on its own, but we think a system built by layering these mechanisms can go a considerable way towards solving the containment problem in practice. In this section we have gathered some project suggestions for helping to resolve some of the remaining questions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Code integrity enforcement: Write something which can inspect a paused (or running) virtual machine and determine whether it is running any code that is not present on a whitelist, including support for just-in-time compiled languages like Lua. Adapt Off-the-Shelf Software: Set up containers using existing virtual machine software and OS sandboxing mechanisms, make these work with common machine learning libraries and document the configuration required to make them secure. Hardened AGI Infrastructure: Machine learning libraries are typically written without giving much thought to security, and for performance reasons, many of them are written in or use components written in memory-unsafe languages like C++. Test the most common machine learning libraries for vulnerabilities that an AGI could exploit if its code used parts of that library and it could control their inputs. Similar problems may exist with game console emulators and other software used for evaluating AGI performance. Red-team events: Set up mock scenarios in which a security researcher is placed in the context an AGI would be, and see what they can do. Hardened debuggers: Commonly-used debuggers are not designed to be used with programs that might be malicious, and may contain vulnerabilities that allow debugging targets to break out of sandboxes or provide misleading information. Implement a more robust mechanism for controlling and inspecting program execution.\n",

            "\n",
            "We have outlined an approach to the AGI containment problem that seems feasible, but will require additional work to actually implement. While there is likely significant time remaining before anyone is able to create an AGI that is general enough and intelligent enough for containment to be relevant, history shows that secure software requires considerable time to mature. Developing containment technologies now is also likely to reveal issues that inform the next and subsequent generations of AGI containers.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is considerable uncertainty about when AGI will be developed and what kinds of designs will be required to avert undesired outcomes [13] , but across most plausible scenarios, deploying AGI containment systems would help ensure that reliable AGI testing can be performed even with AGIs that approach human-level capability at understanding the world around them.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are unanswered questions about how to build these systems, but we think significant progress can be made by pursuing the project ideas we have laid out. The earlier this work begins, the more opportunity there will be for unforeseen difficulties to surface, and for any resulting security software to mature. This is a perfect chance to help the research community prepare to tackle the challenges of a post-human future.\n",

            "There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and motivations future AGIs will have. In some plausible scenarios, AGIs may pose security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments, make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem -the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available mechanisms, and weaknesses that need to be addressed.\n",

Some commentators are reassured [16] by the observation that current AGI software, like other software, can be interrupted easily, for example by powering down the hardware. However, it's a mistake to assume that this will always be sufficient, because an AGI that understands its situation can come up with strategies to avoid or circumvent this safety measure. Containment is, in a nutshell, the problem of making this work: preventing the AGI from tampering with its environment without authorization, and maintaining the integrity of observations of the AGI dur\n",

            "\n",
            "focusing in on your current-state first can cause you to unwittingly limit your vision and the scope of what your future-state may be.\n",
            "a current-state first focus often results in organizations remediating, optimizing, and evolving existing business processes and models, rather than transforming them.\n",
            "focusing on your current-state first and foremost makes it very difficult to determine what business processes, information, or technology should be eliminated, and what emerging processes, information or technology should be adopted.\n",
            "\n",
            "Last, focusing on the current-state can be a bit depressing for business and IT leaders, as well as users; people get focused on what's wrong with the organization, and easily fall into infighting, protecting domains, and complaining.\n",
            "The Power of Future-State\n",
            "With future-state-first planning, organizations look at what's happening in their market, society, economy, and emerging business and technology context, and then use this information to guide scenario planning, analysis, and strategic planning.\n",
            "Once this outcome-driven view of your future is identified, the organization can then look at its current-state and see if that future-state vision is valid or if it needs to be refined.\n",
            "Organizations can then use this vision to figure out how the current-state people, process, information, and technology need to be evolved to achieve that future-state. And they can determine what new technologies or resources need to be brought in, and what existing resources need to be eliminated.\n",
            "Future-state planning is a great way to get business and IT leaders as well as users excited and interested in the opportunities that lie ahead.\n",
            "The big difference is that a future-state approach looks at the opportunities in our future and then uses this vision to inform both tactical and strategic investment decisions. Whereas a current-state vision is focused more on what we fix and how to evolve our current-state.\n",
            "Future-State Planning in Business Practice\n",
            "I was once working with a European financial services organization that was considering what its future might look like, particularly given economic, regulatory, political, and societal changes.\n",
            "When they looked at the future and the trends that were going to impact their business, they realized that they had the opportunity to provide transaction management services to a wide variety of industries, not just financial services.\n",
            "They created a business model whereby they deliver financial-based transaction services to support their existing customers. And, they are adding open interfaces and connectors so they can be an iPaaS to support other businesses that need transaction capabilities.\n",
            "If they had not thought in terms of future-state first, they would likely have never even considered radically different business models and would have stuck with financial services business models. But starting with a future-state approach gave them the freedom to think out of the box.\n",

            "As many of you may know, I recently went through the experience of having my house and all my belongings destroyed in the recent fires in California. I've been applying this future-state thinking to my own efforts during this rebuild and recovery.\n",
            "We now have a vision of a new house that is built from the start using sustainable and efficient building materials and techniques. I envision the future-state of our property, and even having a big party once this is all behind us.\n",
            "I have found this to be a very powerful and positive driving force. Frankly, if I was focused on current-state, I would probably sit down in the middle of the ashes and cry. Focusing on the current-state is too overwhelming and negative.\n",
            "Focusing on the future-state has kept us positive and moving forward in a logical way. I know that the future-state vision will evolve and will likely change due to current-state constraints. However, focusing on a changing and evolving future-state is much more positive, inspiring, and manageable.\n",
            "Bottom Line\n",
            "For years I have applied future-state architecture to technology-driven business challenges. I have seen the positive impact it can have on teams and leaders. I have also experienced the value of using that vision to make tactical and strategic investment decisions.\n",
            "To have the opportunity to apply this in my personal life has been very interesting and valuable. There is little value in sitting in the middle of ashes; there is huge value in using our future-state vision to figure out what to do with those ashes...and everything else.\n",

Access to the tool increases productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 14 percent on average, with the greatest impact on novice and low-skilled workers, and minimal impact on experienced and highly skilled workers. We provide suggestive evidence that the AI model disseminates the potentially tacit knowledge of more able workers and helps newer workers move down the experience curve. In addition, we show that AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces requests for managerial intervention, and improves employee retention.\n",
